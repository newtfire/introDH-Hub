##14850 <p> Editor 's note : The third and final presidential debate will focus exclusively on foreign policy and national security . Four CFR experts weigh in on the questions and issues they believe warrant discussion . This briefing was originally published here . The views expressed are the authors ' own . <p> Stephen Biddle , Adjunct Senior Fellow for Defense Policy <p> Afghanistan <p> We know both candidates want to bring U.S. troops home from Afghanistan . And we know they have about the same timetable for doing it . What we do n't know is how this will secure our interests there . <p> The war is likely to be stalemated in 2014 when the U.S. combat role ends and the Afghans take the lead . To maintain that stalemate will require multiple billions of dollars a year to keep Afghanistan 's security forces in the field . If we 're going to keep writing these checks , what 's the plan for bringing the war to a successful conclusion after 2014 ? Is there one ? <p> The Afghanistan debate is usually about getting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if our only goal is to leave , then we could have done that years ago and saved thousands of American lives . Presumably , we 're continuing to fight because we have something at stake beyond just coming home . Yet neither candidate has articulated what this is and how itwill be secured after 2014 when our role in the war is smaller , our influence is lower , our Afghan ally remains highly imperfect , and our Taliban opponents persist . <p> U.S. subsidies can probably keep Afghan government forces fighting after 2014 , but how long can a stalemated war drag on before U.S. taxpayers -- or Afghan troops -- tire of this ? Are we betting that the Taliban will lose heart before our allies or our Congress do ? Why ? Are we betting on a negotiated peace settlement in the meantime ? If so , what are we doing to forge a deal , and how can we make it stick after our troops mostly come home ? <p> If we have interests there worth sacrificing lives for , we deserve to know how these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost . If our interests are n't worth fighting for , why would these candidates keep us fighting there until 2014 ? <p> So the most important question for the candidates on Afghanistan is : we know you want to leave , but is that all ? If our interests are worth fighting for , how do you intend to secure them ? <p> First the good news : Unlike the Middle East , China is not reeling from one crisis to another as the United States struggles to find effective policy tools . It does not provide safe haven for terrorists , nor did it trigger the global financial crisis . For the purposes of the presidential debate on foreign policy , that makes China seem like a second-tier issue . <p> Now for the not so good news : China may well pose a far more serious strategic challenge to the United States and the global system . Chinese officials have called for the world to move away from the dollar as the reserve currency , challenged U.S. notions of good governance throughout the world , and blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of this makes China an issue of paramount importance for the presidential debate . <p> The campaigns have already targeted China as a critical issue , but not in a way that elevates the discourse . China-bashing television ads and debate over whose pension fund has Chinese companies are not going to help the American people understand who would better manage U.S.-China relations and China 's rise . Fortunately , Bob Shieffer 's debate topic , " The rise of China and tomorrow 's world , " suggests that he is already thinking along these lines . What specific questions might he ask ? Here are four : <p> -- China has a seat on the U.N . Security Council , the world 's second largest economy , and one of the world 's largest standing armies . Yet it remains reluctant to assume a leading role in addressing global challenges . How can the next U.S. president ensure that China works with the United States and does its fair share to meet the world 's most pressing global problems ? <p> -- China 's economy is widely anticipated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States -- within the next five to ten years . What difference , if any , do you expect this eventuality will make in the U.S.-China relationship and in global economic relations ? <p> -- In the past several months , a number of conflicts have flared up in the Asia-Pacific regionbetween China and its neighbors . Some have blamed the U.S. pivot for emboldening actors in the region to take provocative actions . Mr. President , is this growing regional tension the outcome you anticipated or did you miscalculate ? What further steps would you take to help decrease tensions ? Governor Romney , you have asserted that the pivot was oversold and under-resourced . Please explain what you would do differently . <p> -- China has achieved extraordinary economic success with a one-party authoritarian system that continues to limit many of the basic human rights that we in the United States value and have fought for throughout the world . Does China present a credible alternative development model for other countries ? <p> Isobel Coleman , Senior Fellow and Director of the Civil Society , Markets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Policy Program <p> Middle East <p> The turmoil in the Middle East -- from the Arab uprisings to the civil war in Syria to the Iranian nuclear threat -- poses enormous foreign policy challenges for the United States , with real implications for our security and prosperity . So far , the candidates have spent more time trying to score political points over the tragic attack on our consulate in Benghazi than explaining where they stand on the serious issues at hand . With a full half-hour of the next debate slated to focus on " The Changing Middle East and the New Face of Terrorism , " they should have plenty of time to articulate their positions . Here are some questions the moderator could ask : <p> -- The transitions underway in Tunisia and Egypt have brought Islamists into power in both countries through legitimate elections . These governments are writing new constitutions , and already deep divisions are coming to the fore over such fundamental issues as the role of Islam in the legal system , freedom of expression , human rights , and equality . The United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with countries in the Middle East . What would you do to maintain such relationships in the face of differences over values and human rights ? <p> -- In addition , how should we deal with those authoritarian governments , including Saudi Arabia and Bahrain , that are deeply resistant to democracy but remain close U.S. allies ? <p> -- In a recent op-ed , Governor Mitt Romney wrote that the United States should use the " full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity for those who have for too long known only corruption and oppression . " What would you do that we are not already doing to encourage liberty and opportunity in the Middle East ? <p> -- Americans are understandably reluctant to become embroiled in another war in the Middle East , but as the situation in Syria continues to deteriorate , the costs of standing on the sidelines -- in terms of human tragedy , regional instability , and rising extremism -- are growing . At what point does your cost-benefit calculation tip toward greater U.S. intervention ? <p> -- While Iran 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the regime 's record of repression of its own people is also deeply disturbing . In 2006 , the Bush Administration allocated $75 million to support the promotion of democracy , freedom , and human rights in Iran . However , the program struggled to find Iranian activists and organizations willing to take the funding due to fear of reprisal from the regime . Given this history , and the international community 's commitment to preventing a nuclear Iran , how will you move to support human rights and political dissidents in Iran ? <p> -- Despite general Israeli and Palestinian support for a two-state solution , the prospects for resolving that conflict appear grim . President Obama , you 've called the status quo unsustainable and have reiterated your commitment to a two-state solution . Mr. Romney , you 've made comments calling into question the viability of a two-state solution . What roles do each of you envision the United States playing in revitalizing Israeli-Palestinian peace talks ? <p> Robert Kahn , Steven A. Tananbaum Senior Fellow for International Economics <p> The Global Economy <p> Most Americans view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the critical foreign policy challenges we face . Yet our economies are interconnected . Crises elsewhere can have profound effects on the U.S. economy , and conversely our failure to deal with our challenges at home has global implications . Getting these policies right can influence our standing in the world , the resources we can bring to problems , and our capacity to act . <p> The global economy today is in a fragile state , with growth slowing in industrial and emerging economies alike . The IMF recently marked down global growth sharply and highlighted a wide array of risks that could lead to recession next year . There are three areas in particular where US leadership is central to brighter global prospects . <p> -- Europe . The Obama administration 's strategy has been to work closely with our European counterparts , press them to move faster to address the root causes of the crisis , while arguing Europe has the resources to solve the problem and must lead . Governor Romney has advocated a more arms-length strategy , opposing U.S.-backed bailouts through the IMF . Neither supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we believe the Europeans are n't moving fast enough , it would be interesting to hear from the candidates what needs to be done and how we can have influence on the debate " leading from behind . " <p> -- Fiscal cliff . We all know that going off the fiscal cliff in December could tip the U.S. economy into recession . Longer term , our failure to put our finances on a sustainable track and provide for needed investment will lead to crisis . When this happens is uncertain , but surely the costs will be lower if we address it sooner rather than later . Even in the context of a foreign policy debate , the candidates could address their specific plans to avoid the cliff . The threat to global growth would only seem to add to the urgency for action . <p> -- China . Both candidates promise to be tough on trade and investment with China . Governor Romney would cite China as an exchange rate manipulator at the start of his administration . This would initiate a new round of negotiations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the debate is how to specifically address the broader array of without initiating a destabilizing trade dispute . <h> We recommend <h> From around the web <h> sound off ( 6 Responses ) <p> Salman J <p> Bahrain resistant to democracy ? Bahrain started on their path of democracy back in 2002 with the creation of Parliament -- when there was n't even an Arab Spring . This proactive initiative was ahead of anyone else in the immediate region , which proves that Bahrain acts as an independent nation in regards to their political and social ideologies . The Government are enforcing laws to ensure that they continue on this path . Unfortunately , Bahrain is a victim of of the Arab Spring context and the regional stereotype . But know this , Bahraini Government got it right ? Yes , we are not where everyone wants us to be , but we are also not where everyone thinks we are . The happy medium provides the country with stability , and sets a solid foundation to build the nation on . Otherwise , the country will crumble like these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes there 's a lot at stake when the US leaves Afghanistan in 2014 . Much -- blood and treasure -- would be in vain , if the Taliban returns . America is far away and it 's too costly to stay on there in a minor role . Yet other countries -- those Central Asian ones -- are more likely to be worried about Afghanistan . The US should approach these countries and help them secure the region . <p> Elizabeth Economy , China might be reluctant to take on more responsible roles and tackle global challenges , but it has it has its own agenda and acts like a lone-wolf . In some parts of Africa and Latin America , China uses its spendings and investments as foreign policies . It wants to establish its sets of rules as a way to reform the international organisations . <p> Isobel Colem , indeed , countries in the Middle East will have to find a way between 1 ) practising political Islam and co-existing with , the minorities , 2 ) autocratic rule and power-sharing with the people .

Although Mies Van Der Rohe adopted this in an architectural context its economic and political connotations are indeed powerful . Empowering subjugated minorities in India by splitting it into smaller states would trigger uber economic demand for western nations who have given so much financial and technology aid to India with no return to show for the investment . I concur with this approach and with economic background find the premise to be on solid footing . Central Asian States ( CAS ) are a case in point on this successful approach . We need to understand that India has an unmanageable large population mired in poverty and we are spinning our wheels trying to feed it . It is also too big of a geographical unit to govern .

( In fact I was asked before this match if I 'd take a draw , and I said yes . ) Now I ca n't help but feel robbed of a win given that Liverpool were -- shockingly -- the better side .

##23451 <h> Do the Olympics cost too much for host cities ? <p> London has already exceeded its initial Olympics budget by a wide margin . <p> NEW YORK ( CNNMoney ) -- Hosting the Olympic Games is a lot like throwing the world 's largest -- and most expensive -- party . <p> The costs are legion . Massive new infrastructure projects must be planned , funded and constructed . Security forces are mobilized , with costs ranging into the billions of dollars . Thousands of hotel rooms must be built to house athletes and tourists . <p> The two most recent Summer Games had drastically different outcomes . The Olympics in Beijing in 2008 were widely considered a success , mainly because it helped the nation show the world how much it had emerged as an economic power . <p> " Beijing did it as an advertisement . They got tremendous value , because they did n't care about the cost . It was like buying a ton of television ads , " said Mark Rosentraub , a professor of sports management at the University of Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experts say that Greece built too many hotel rooms and fell victim to the hopes that the Olympics would lead to longer-term gains thanks to tourism . <p> Matheson said that forecasts produced to justify the Olympics often underestimate potential spending overruns , and rely on models that do n't accurately capture unintended costs . <p> " I would say these folks are really good at adding and multiplying , but not very good at subtracting , " Matheson said . <p> Stefan Szymanski , another professor of sports management at the University of Michigan , said that politicians feel pressured to link the Olympics to economic gains because taxpayers bear the cost of putting on the games . <p> " The government wants to say that not only are we going to have a good time with this event , but it 's also going to make us rich , " Szymanski said . " And that 's just not true . " <p> Perhaps the best example of the long-term costs associated with putting on the Olympics is Montreal , host city of the 1976 Summer Games . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jean Drapeau , followed the course of most elected leaders who court the games , saying that " the Olympics can no more lose money than a man can have a baby . " <p> He was wrong . Mismanagement and gross cost overruns left the city 's citizens with a $1.5 billion debt that took three decades to erase . The final payment on the debt was made in 2006 . <p> By that time , the local citizenry had turned the name of the city 's unused Olympic stadium-turned baseball park , the Big O , into a homonym : the Big O-W-E . <p> Montreal 's experience went a long way toward scaring off potential host cities for 1984 , and only one municipality -- Los Angeles -- made a bid for those Olympic Games . <p> Because of low demand , Matheson said , Los Angeles was able to dictate terms to the International Olympic Committee . It pursued a new model that relied heavily on private financing . <p> The city was also able to use existing stadiums as sports venues , erasing one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result ? Profit . <p> Rosentraub said there are two ways to turn the games into a financial success . <p> The first is to adopt the Los Angeles model , and rely on existing facilities to host events . The second is to use the Olympics as an impetus to build long-term infrastructure projects that would be needed with or without the games . <p> It is probably too

For serious reading , you want the Adobe Acrobat version . <p> a / The vibrations of this electric bass string are converted to electrical vibrations , then to sound vibrations , and finally to vibrations of our eardrums . <h> Chapter 6 . Waves <p> Dandelion . Cello . Read those two words , and your brain instantly conjures a stream of associations , the most prominent of which have to do with vibrations . Our mental category of " dandelion-ness " is strongly linked to the color of light waves that vibrate about half a million billion times a second : yellow . The velvety throb of a cello has as its most obvious characteristic a relatively low musical pitch --- the note you 're spontaneously imagining right now might be one whose sound vibrations repeat at a rate of a hundred times a second . <p> Evolution seems to have designed our two most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waves , whereas up until now , we 've mostly taken the view that Nature can be understood by breaking her down into smaller and smaller parts , ending up with particles as her most fundamental building blocks . Does that work for light and sound ? Sound waves are disturbances in air , which is made of atoms , but light , on the other hand , is n't a vibration of atoms . Light , unlike sound , can travel through a vacuum : if you 're reading this by sunlight , you 're taking advantage of light that had to make it through millions of miles of vacuum to get to you . Waves , then , are not just a trick that vibrating atoms can do . Waves are one of the basic phenomena of the universe . At the end of this book , we 'll even see that the things we 've been calling particles , such as electrons , are really waves ! 1 <h> 6.1 Free Waves <p> a / Your finger makes a depression in the surface of the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you remove your finger . <p> d / As the wave pulse goes by , the ribbon tied to the spring is not carried along . The motion of the wave pattern is to the right , but the medium ( spring ) is moving from side to side , not to the right . ( PSSC Physics ) <p> g / Example 4 . The boat has run up against a limit on its speed because it ca n't climb over its own wave . Dolphins get around the problem by leaping out of the water . <p> h / Circular and linear wave patterns . <p> i / Plane and spherical wave patterns . <h> 6.1.1 Wave motion <p> Let 's start with an intuition-building exercise that deals with waves in matter , since they 're easier than light waves to get your hands on . Put your fingertip in the middle of a cup of water and then remove it suddenly . You 'll have noticed two results that are surprising to most people . First , the flat surface of the water does not simply sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , ripples spread out , and the process of flattening out occurs over a long period of time , during which the water at the center vibrates above and below the normal water level . This type of wave motion is the topic of the present section . Second , you 've found that the ripples bounce off of the walls of the cup , in much the same way that a ball would bounce off of a wall . In the next section we discuss what happens to waves that have a boundary around them . Until then , we confine ourselves to wave phenomena that can be analyzed as if the medium ( e.g. , the water ) was infinite and the same everywhere . <p> It is n't hard to understand why removing your fingertip creates ripples rather than simply allowing the water to sink back down uniformly . The initial crater , a /1 , left behind by your finger has sloping sides , and the water next to the crater flows downhill to fill in the hole . The water far away , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has happened , because there is no slope for it to flow down . As the hole fills up , the rising water at the center gains upward momentum , and overshoots , creating a little hill where there had been a hole originally . The area just outside of this region has been robbed of some of its water in order to build the hill , so a depressed " moat " is formed , a /2 . This effect cascades outward , producing ripples . <p> There are three main ways in which wave motion differs from the motion of objects made of matter . <p> b / The two circular patterns of ripples pass through each other . Unlike material objects , wave patterns can overlap in space , and when this happens they combine by addition . <h> 1 . Superposition <p> If you watched the water in the cup carefully , you noticed the ghostlike behavior of the reflected ripples coming back toward the center of the cup and the outgoing ripples that had n't yet been reflected : they passed right through each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , difference between wave motion and the motion of objects : waves do not display any repulsion of each other analogous to the normal forces between objects that come in contact . Two wave patterns can therefore overlap in the same region of space , as shown in figure b . Where the two waves coincide , they add together . For instance , suppose that at a certain location in at a certain moment in time , each wave would have had a crest 3 cm above the normal water level . The waves combine at this point to make a 6-cm crest . We use negative numbers to represent depressions in the water . If both waves would have had a troughs measuring -3 cm , then they combine to make an extra-deep -6 cm trough . A +3 cm crest and a -3 cm trough result in a height of zero , i.e. , the waves momentarily cancel each other out at that point . This additive rule is referred to as the principle of superposition , " superposition " being merely a fancy word for " adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves like the ones in the figure above but with waves of any shape . The figures on the following page show superposition of wave pulses . A pulse is simply a wave of very short duration . These pulses consist only of a single hump or trough . If you hit a clothesline sharply , you will observe pulses heading off in both directions . This is analogous to the way ripples spread out in all directions when you make a disturbance at one point on water . The same occurs when the hammer on a piano comes up and hits a string . <p> Experiments to date have not shown any deviation from the principle of superposition in the case of light waves . For other types of waves , it is typically a very good approximation for low-energy waves . <p> c / As the wave pattern passes the rubber duck , the duck stays put . The water is n't moving with the wave . <h> 2 . The medium is not transported with the wave . <p> The sequence of three photos in figure c shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber duck ( left ) , having just passed the duck ( middle ) and having progressed about a meter beyond the duck ( right ) . The duck bobs around its initial position , but is not carried along with the wave . This shows that the water itself does not flow outward with the wave . If it did , we could empty one end of a swimming pool simply by kicking up waves ! We must distinguish between the motion of the medium ( water in this case ) and the motion of the wave pattern through the medium . The medium vibrates ; the wave progresses through space . <p> self-check : <p> In figure d , you can detect the side-to-side motion of the spring because the spring appears blurry . At a certain instant , represented by a single photo , how would you describe the motion of the different parts of the spring ? Other than the flat parts , do any parts of the spring have zero velocity ? <p> ( answer in the back of the PDF version of the book ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure is moving to the right . The wave pattern , a pulse consisting of a compressed area of its body , moves to the left . In other words , the motion of the wave pattern is in the opposite direction compared to the motion of the medium . <h> Example 2 : Surfing <p> The incorrect belief that the medium moves with the wave is often reinforced by garbled secondhand knowledge of surfing . Anyone who has actually surfed knows that the front of the board pushes the water to the sides , creating a wake --- the surfer can even drag his hand through the water , as in in figure e . If the water was moving along with the wave and the surfer , this would n't happen . The surfer is carried forward because forward is downhill , not because of any forward flow of the water . If the water was flowing forward , then a person floating in the water up to her neck would be carried along just as quickly as someone on a surfboard . In fact , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave , although the ride would n't last very long because the surfer and the wave would quickly part company . <h> 3 . A wave 's velocity depends on the medium . <p> A material object can move with any velocity , and can be sped up or slowed down by a force that increases or decreases its kinetic energy . Not so with waves . The speed of a wave , depends on the properties of the medium ( and perhaps also on the shape of the wave , for certain types of waves ) . Sound waves travel at about 340 m/s in air , 1000 m/s in helium . If you kick up water waves in a pool , you will find that kicking harder makes waves that are taller ( and therefore carry more energy ) , not faster . The sound waves from an exploding stick of dynamite carry a lot of energy , but are no faster than any other waves . In the following section we will give an example of the physical relationship between the wave speed and the properties of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velocity of water waves increases with depth . The crest of a wave travels faster than the trough , and this can cause the wave to break . <p> Once a wave is created , the only reason its speed will change is if it enters a different medium or if the properties of the medium change . It is not so surprising that a change in medium can slow down a wave , but the reverse can also happen . A sound wave traveling through a helium balloon will slow down when it emerges into the air , but if it enters another balloon it will speed back up again ! Similarly , water waves travel more quickly over deeper water , so a wave will slow down as it passes over an underwater ridge , but speed up again as it emerges into deeper water . <h> Example 4 : Hull speed <p> The speeds of most boats , and of some surface-swimming animals , are limited by the fact that they make a wave due to their motion through the water . The boat in figure g is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ca n't go any faster . No matter how hard the boat pushes against the water , it ca n't make the wave move ahead faster and get out of the way . The wave 's speed depends only on the medium . Adding energy to the wave does n't speed it up , it just increases its amplitude . <p> A water wave , unlike many other types of wave , has a speed that depends on its shape : a broader wave moves faster . The shape of the wave made by a boat tends to mold itself to the shape of the boat 's hull , so a boat with a longer hull makes a broader wave that moves faster . The maximum speed of a boat whose speed is limited by this effect is therefore closely related to the length of its hull , and the maximum speed is called the hull speed . Sailboats designed for racing are not just long and skinny to make them more streamlined --- they are also long so that their hull speeds will be high . <h> Wave patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is preordained , what about its direction ? Waves spread out in all directions from every point on the disturbance that created them . If the disturbance is small , we may consider it as a single point , and in the case of water waves the resulting wave pattern is the familiar circular ripple , h /1 . If , on the other hand , we lay a pole on the surface of the water and wiggle it up and down , we create a linear wave pattern , h /2 . For a three-dimensional wave such as a sound wave , the analogous patterns would be spherical waves and plane waves , i . <p> Infinitely many patterns are possible , but linear or plane waves are often the simplest to analyze , because the velocity vector is in the same direction no matter what part of the wave we look at . Since all the velocity vectors are parallel to one another , the problem is effectively one-dimensional . Throughout this chapter and the next , we will restrict ourselves mainly to wave motion in one dimension , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done without too much complication . <h> Discussion Questions <p> ? <p> The left panel of the figure shows a sequence of snapshots of two positive pulses on a coil spring as they move through each other . In the right panel , which shows a positive pulse and a negative one , the fifth frame has the spring just about perfectly flat . If the two pulses have essentially canceled each other out perfectly , then why does the motion pick up again ? Why does n't the spring just stay flat ? <p> Sketch two positive wave pulses on a string that are overlapping but not right on top of each other , and draw their superposition . Do the same for a positive pulse running into a negative pulse . <p> ? <p> A traveling wave pulse is moving to the right on a string . Sketch the velocity vectors of the various parts of the string . Now do the same for a pulse moving to the left . <p> ? <p> In a spherical sound wave spreading out from a point , how would the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ k / Hitting a key on a piano causes a hammer to come up from underneath and hit a string ( actually a set of three ) .

The first half of this subsection aims to build your intuition by investigating a simple , one-dimensional type of wave : a wave on a string . If you have ever stretched a string between the bottoms of two open-mouthed cans to talk to a friend , you were putting this type of wave to work . Stringed instruments are another good example . Although we usually think of a piano wire simply as vibrating , the hammer actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which then ripples out in both directions . Since this chapter is about free waves , not bounded ones , we pretend that our string is infinitely long . <p> After the qualitative discussion , we will use simple approximations to investigate the speed of a wave pulse on a string . This quick and dirty treatment is then followed by a rigorous attack using the methods of calculus , which turns out to be both simpler and more general . <h> Intuitive ideas <p> Consider a string that has been struck , l /1 , resulting in the creation of two wave pulses , l /2 , one traveling to the left and one to the right . This is analogous to the way ripples spread out in all directions from a splash in water , but on a one-dimensional string , " all directions " becomes " both directions . " <p> We can gain insight by modeling the string as a series of masses connected by springs , m . ( In the actual string the mass and the springiness are both contributed by the molecules themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string , there will be some areas that are flat , 1 , some that are sloping but not curved , 2 , and some that are curved , 3 and 4 . In example 1 it is clear that both the forces on the central mass cancel out , so it will not accelerate . The same is true of 2 , however . Only in curved regions such as 3 and 4 is an acceleration produced . In these examples , the vector sum of the two forces acting on the central mass is not zero . The important concept is that curvature makes force : the curved areas of a wave tend to experience forces resulting in an acceleration toward the mouth of the curve . Note , however , that an uncurved portion of the string need not remain motionless . It may move at constant velocity to either side . <h> Approximate treatment <p> We now carry out an approximate treatment of the speed at which two pulses will spread out from an initial indentation on a string . For simplicity , we imagine a hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will estimate the amount of time , t , required until each of the pulses has traveled a distance equal to the width of the pulse itself . The velocity of the pulses is then w / t . <p> As always , the velocity of a wave depends on the properties of the medium , in this case the string . The properties of the string can be summarized by two variables : the tension , T , and the mass per unit length , ? ( Greek letter mu ) . <p> If we consider the part of the string encompassed by the initial dent as a single object , then this object has a mass of approximately ? w ( mass/length x length=mass ) . ( Here , and throughout the derivation , we assume that h is much less than w , so that we can ignore the fact that this segment of the string has a length slightly greater than w . ) Although the downward acceleration of this segment of the string will be neither constant over time nor uniform across the pulse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our simple estimate . Roughly speaking , the time interval between n /1 and n /2 is the amount of time required for the initial dent to accelerate from rest and reach its normal , flattened position . Of course the tip of the triangle has a longer distance to travel than the edges , but again we ignore the complications and simply assume that the segment as a whole must travel a distance h . Indeed , it might seem surprising that the triangle would so neatly spring back to a perfectly flat shape . It is an experimental fact that it does , but our analysis is too crude to address such details . <p> The string is kinked , i.e. , tightly curved , at the edges of the triangle , so it is here that there will be large forces that do not cancel out to zero . There are two forces acting on the triangular hump , one of magnitude T acting down and to the right , and one of the same magnitude acting down and to the left . If the angle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the segment equals 2 T sin ? . Dividing the triangle into two right triangles , we see that sin ? equals h divided by the length of one of the sloping sides . Since h is much less than w , the length of the sloping side is essentially the same as w /2 , so we have sin ? = 2 h / w , and F =4 Th / w . The acceleration of the segment ( actually the acceleration of its center of mass ) is <p> The time required to move a distance h under constant acceleration a is found by solving h = ( 1/2 ) at 2 to yield <p> Our final result for the speed of the pulses is <p> The remarkable feature of this result is that the velocity of the pulses does not depend at all on w or h , i.e. , any triangular pulse has the same speed . It is an experimental fact ( and we will also prove rigorously below ) that any pulse of any kind , triangular or otherwise , travels along the string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many approximations we can not expect to have gotten all the numerical factors right . The correct result for the speed of the pulses is <p> The importance of the above derivation lies in the insight it brings ---that all pulses move with the same speed --- rather than in the details of the numerical result . The reason for our too-high value for the velocity is not hard to guess . It comes from the assumption that the acceleration was constant , when actually the total force on the segment would diminish as it flattened out . <h> Treatment using calculus <p> After expending considerable effort for an approximate solution , we now display the power of calculus with a rigorous and completely general treatment that is nevertheless much shorter and easier . Let the flat position of the string define the x axis , so that y measures how far a point on the string is from equilibrium . The motion of the string is characterized by y ( x , t ) , a function of two variables . Knowing that the force on any small segment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , and that the second derivative is a measure of curvature , it is not surprising to find that the infinitesimal force dF acting on an infinitesimal segment dx is given by <p> ( This can be proved by vector addition of the two infinitesimal forces acting on either side . ) The symbol ? stands for a partial derivative , e.g. , ? / ? x means a derivative with respect to x that is evaluated while treating t as a constant . The acceleration is then a = dF / dm , or , substituting dm = ? dx , <p> The second derivative with respect to time is related to the second derivative with respect to position . This is no more than a fancy mathematical statement of the intuitive fact developed above , that the string accelerates so as to flatten out its curves . <p> Before even bothering to look for solutions to this equation , we note that it already proves the principle of superposition , because the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives . Therefore the sum of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on experiment , we expect that this equation will be satisfied by any function y ( x , t ) that describes a pulse or wave pattern moving to the left or right at the correct speed v . In general , such a function will be of the form y = f ( x - vt ) or y = f ( x + vt ) , where f is any function of one variable . Because of the chain rule , each derivative with respect to time brings out a factor of v . Evaluating the second derivatives on both sides of the equation gives <p> Squaring gets rid of the sign , and we find that we have a valid solution for any function f , provided that v is given by <h> 6.1.3 Sound and light waves <h> Sound waves <p> The phenomenon of sound is easily found to have all the characteristics we expect from a wave phenomenon : <p> - Sound waves obey superposition . Sounds do not knock other sounds out of the way when they collide , and we can hear more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously . <p> - The medium does not move with the sound . Even standing in front of a titanic speaker playing earsplitting music , we do not feel the slightest breeze . <p> - The velocity of sound depends on the medium . Sound travels faster in helium than in air , and faster in water than in helium . Putting more energy into the wave makes it more intense , not faster . For example , you can easily detect an echo when you clap your hands a short distance from a large , flat wall , and the delay of the echo is no shorter for a louder clap . <p> Although not all waves have a speed that is independent of the shape of the wave , and this property therefore is irrelevant to our collection of evidence that sound is a wave phenomenon , sound does nevertheless have this property . For instance , the music in a large concert hall or stadium may take on the order of a second to reach someone seated in the nosebleed section , but we do not notice or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . Bass , drums , and vocals all head outward from the stage at 340 m/s , regardless of their differing wave shapes . ( The speed of sound in a gas is related to the gas 's physical properties in example 13 on p. 373 . ) <p> If sound has all the properties we expect from a wave , then what type of wave is it ? It is a series of compressions and expansions of the air . Even for a very loud sound , the increase or decrease compared to normal atmospheric pressure is no more than a part per million , so our ears are apparently very sensitive instruments . In a vacuum , there is no medium for the sound waves , and so they can not exist . The roars and whooshes of space ships in Hollywood movies are fun , but scientifically wrong . <h> Light waves <p> Entirely similar observations lead us to believe that light is a wave , although the concept of light as a wave had a long and tortuous history . It is interesting to note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The belief that matter was made of atoms was stylish at the time among radical thinkers ( although there was no experimental evidence for their existence ) , and it seemed logical to Newton that light as well should be made of tiny particles , which he called corpuscles ( Latin for " small objects " ) . Newton 's triumphs in the science of mechanics , i.e. , the study of matter , brought him such great prestige that nobody bothered to question his incorrect theory of light for 150 years . One persuasive proof that light is a wave is that according to Newton 's theory , two intersecting beams of light should experience at least some disruption because of collisions between their corpuscles . Even if the corpuscles were extremely small , and collisions therefore very infrequent , at least some dimming should have been measurable . In fact , very delicate experiments have shown that there is no dimming . <p> The wave theory of light was entirely successful up until the 20th century , when it was discovered that not all the phenomena of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now believed that both light and matter are made out of tiny chunks which have both wave and particle properties . For now , we will content ourselves with the wave theory of light , which is capable of explaining a great many things , from cameras to rainbows . <p> If light is a wave , what is waving ? What is the medium that wiggles when a light wave goes by ? It is n't air . A vacuum is impenetrable to sound , but light from the stars travels happily through zillions of miles of empty space . Light bulbs have no air inside them , but that does n't prevent the light waves from leaving the filament . For a long time , physicists assumed that there must be a mysterious medium for light waves , and they called it the ether ( not to be confused with the chemical ) . Supposedly the ether existed everywhere in space , and was immune to vacuum pumps . The details of the story are more fittingly reserved for later in this course , but the end result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any evidence for the ether , and it is no longer believed to exist . Instead , light can be explained as a wave pattern made up of electrical and magnetic fields . <p> o / A graph of pressure versus time for a periodic sound wave , the vowel " ah . " <p> p / A similar graph for a nonperiodic wave , " sh . " <p> q / A strip chart recorder . <p> r / A water wave profile created by a series of repeating pulses . <p> s / Wavelengths of linear and circular waves . <p> t / Ultrasound , i.e. , sound with frequencies higher than the range of human hearing , was used to make this image of a fetus . The resolution of the image is related to the wavelength , since details smaller than about one wavelength can not be resolved . High resolution therefore requires a short wavelength , corresponding to a high frequency . <p> u / A water wave traveling into a region with different depth will change its wavelength . <h> 6.1.4 Periodic waves <h> Period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio station by selecting a certain frequency . We have already defined period and frequency for vibrations , <p> but what do they signify in the case of a wave ? We can recycle our previous definition simply by stating it in terms of the vibrations that the wave causes as it passes a receiving instrument at a certain point in space . For a sound wave , this receiver could be an eardrum or a microphone . If the vibrations of the eardrum repeat themselves over and over , i.e. , are periodic , then we describe the sound wave that caused them as periodic . Likewise we can define the period and frequency of a wave in terms of the period and frequency of the vibrations it causes . As another example , a periodic water wave would be one that caused a rubber duck to bob in a periodic manner as they passed by it . <p> The period of a sound wave correlates with our sensory impression of musical pitch . A high frequency ( short period ) is a high note . The sounds that really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones that are periodic . It is not possible to sing a nonperiodic sound like " sh " with a definite pitch . <p> The frequency of a light wave corresponds to color . Violet is the high-frequency end of the rainbow , red the low-frequency end . A color like brown that does not occur in a rainbow is not a periodic light wave . Many phenomena that we do not normally think of as light are actually just forms of light that are invisible because they fall outside the range of frequencies our eyes can detect . Beyond the red end of the visible rainbow , there are infrared and radio waves . Past the violet end , we have ultraviolet , x-rays , and gamma rays . <h> Graphs of waves as a function of position <p> Some waves , light sound waves , are easy to study by placing a detector at a certain location in space and studying the motion as a function of time . The result is a graph whose horizontal axis is time . With a water wave , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly . This visual snapshot amounts to a graph of the height of the water wave as a function of position . Any wave can be represented in either way . <p> An easy way to visualize this is in terms of a strip chart recorder , an obsolescing device consisting of a pen that wiggles back and forth as a roll of paper is fed under it . It can be used to record a person 's electrocardiogram , or seismic waves too small to be felt as a noticeable earthquake but detectable by a seismometer . Taking the seismometer as an example , the chart is essentially a record of the ground 's wave motion as a function of time , but if the paper was set to feed at the same velocity as the motion of an earthquake wave , it would also be a full-scale representation of the profile of the actual wave pattern itself . Assuming , as is usually the case , that the wave velocity is a constant number regardless of the wave 's shape , knowing the wave motion as a function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . <h> Wavelength <p> Any wave that is periodic will also display a repeating pattern when graphed as a function of position . The distance spanned by one repetition is referred to as one wavelength . The usual notation for wavelength is ? , the Greek letter lambda . Wavelength is to space as period is to time . <h> Wave velocity related to frequency and wavelength <p> Suppose that we create a repetitive disturbance by kicking the surface of a swimming pool . We are essentially making a series of wave pulses . The wavelength is simply the distance a pulse is able to travel before we make the next pulse . The distance between pulses is ? , and the time between pulses is the period , T , so the speed of the wave is the distance divided by the time , <p> v = ? / T . <p> This important and useful relationship is more commonly written in terms of the frequency , <p> v = f ? . <h> Example 5 : Wavelength of radio waves <p> ? The speed of light is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KMHD , a station whose frequency is 89.1 MHz ? <p> ? Solving for wavelength , we have <p> The size of a radio antenna is closely related to the wavelength of the waves it is intended to receive . The match need not be exact ( since after all one antenna can receive more than one wavelength ! ) , but the ordinary " whip " antenna such as a car 's is 1/4 of a wavelength . An antenna optimized to receive KMHD 's signal would have a length of ( 3.4 m ) /4 = 0.85 m . <p> The equation v = f ? defines a fixed relationship between any two of the variables if the other is held fixed . The speed of radio waves in air is almost exactly the same for all wavelengths and frequencies ( it is exactly the same if they are in a vacuum ) , so there is a fixed relationship between their frequency and wavelength . Thus we can say either " Are we on the same wavelength ? " or " Are we on the same frequency ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave that travels from a region where the medium has one set of properties to an area where the medium behaves differently . The frequency is now fixed , because otherwise the two portions of the wave would otherwise get out of step , causing a kink or discontinuity at the boundary , which would be unphysical . ( A more careful argument is that a kink or discontinuity would have infinite curvature , and waves tend to flatten out their curvature . An infinite curvature would flatten out infinitely fast , i.e. , it could never occur in the first place . ) Since the frequency must stay the same , any change in the velocity that results from the new medium must cause a change in wavelength . <p> The velocity of water waves depends on the depth of the water , so based on ? = v / f , we see that water waves that move into a region of different depth must change their wavelength , as shown in figure u . This effect can be observed when ocean waves come up to the shore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tip of the wave can curl over , resulting in a breaking wave . <h> A note on dispersive waves <p> The discussion of wave velocity given here is actually a little bit of an oversimplification for a wave whose velocity depends on its frequency and wavelength . Such a wave is called a dispersive wave . Nearly all the waves we deal with in this course are nondispersive , but the issue becomes important in chapter 13 , where it is discussed in detail . <h> Sinusoidal waves <p> Sinusoidal waves are the most important special case of periodic waves . In fact , many scientists and engineers would be uncomfortable with defining a waveform like the " ah " vowel sound as having a definite frequency and wavelength , because they consider only sine waves to be pure examples of a certain frequency and wavelengths . Their bias is not unreasonable , since the French mathematician Fourier showed that any periodic wave with frequency f can be constructed as a superposition of sine waves with frequencies f , 2 f , 3 f , ... In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks of all waves . ( Fourier 's result so surprised the mathematical community of France that he was ridiculed the first time he publicly presented his theorem . ) <p> However , what definition to use is really a matter of convenience . Our sense of hearing perceives any two sounds having the same period as possessing the same pitch , regardless of whether they are sine waves or not . This is undoubtedly because our ear-brain system evolved to be able to interpret human speech and animal noises , which are periodic but not sinusoidal . Our eyes , on the other hand , judge a color as pure ( belonging to the rainbow set of colors ) only if it is a sine wave . <h> Discussion Questions <p> ? <p> Suppose we superimpose two sine waves with equal amplitudes but slightly different frequencies , as shown in the figure . What will the superposition look like ? What would this sound like if they were sound waves ? <p> w / The pattern of waves made by a point source moving to the right across the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longer wavelength of the backward-going ones . <p> x / The galaxy M100 in the constellation Coma Berenices . Under higher magnification , the milky clouds reveal themselves to be composed of trillions of stars . <p> y / The telescope at Mount Wilson used by Hubble . <p> z / How do astronomers know what mixture of wavelengths a star emitted originally , so that they can tell how much the Doppler shift was ? This image ( obtained by the author with equipment costing about $5 , and no telescope ) shows the mixture of colors emitted by the star Sirius . ( If you have the book in black and white , blue is on the left and red on the right . ) The star appears white or bluish-white to the eye , but any light looks white if it contains roughly an equal mixture of the rainbow colors , i.e. , of all the pure sinusoidal waves with wavelengths lying in the visible range . Note the black " gap teeth . " These are the fingerprint of hydrogen in the outer atmosphere of Sirius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in our own galaxy , but similar stars in other galaxies would have the whole pattern shifted toward the red end , indicating they are moving away from us . <p> aa / Shock waves are created by the X-15 rocket plane , flying at 3.5 times the speed of sound . <p> ab / This fighter jet has just accelerated past the speed of sound . The sudden decompression of the air causes water droplets to condense , forming a cloud . <h> 6.1.5 The Doppler effect <p> Figure w shows the wave pattern made by the tip of a vibrating rod which is moving across the water . If the rod had been vibrating in one place , we would have seen the familiar pattern of concentric circles , all centered on the same point . But since the source of the waves is moving , the wavelength is shortened on one side and lengthened on the other . This is known as the Doppler effect . <p> Note that the velocity of the waves is a fixed property of the medium , so for example the forward-going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would a material object like a bullet being shot forward from an airplane . <p> We can also infer a change in frequency . Since the velocity is constant , the equation v = f ? tells us that the change in wavelength must be matched by an opposite change in frequency : higher frequency for the waves emitted forward , and lower for the ones emitted backward . The frequency Doppler effect is the reason for the familiar dropping-pitch sound of a race car going by . As the car approaches us , we hear a higher pitch , but after it passes us we hear a frequency that is lower than normal . <p> The Doppler effect will also occur if the observer is moving but the source is stationary . For instance , an observer moving toward a stationary source will perceive one crest of the wave , and will then be surrounded by the next crest sooner than she otherwise would have , because she has moved toward it and hastened her encounter with it . Roughly speaking , the Doppler effect depends only the relative motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute state of motion ( which is not a well-defined notion in physics ) or on their velocity relative to the medium . <p> Restricting ourselves to the case of a moving source , and to waves emitted either directly along or directly against the direction of motion , we can easily calculate the wavelength , or equivalently the frequency , of the Doppler-shifted waves . Let u be the velocity of the source . The wavelength of the forward-emitted waves is shortened by an amount uT equal to the distance traveled by the source over the course of one period . Using the definition f =1/ T and the equation v = f ? , we find for the wavelength ? ' of the Doppler-shifted wave the equation <p> A similar equation can be used for the backward-emitted waves , but with a plus sign rather than a minus sign . <h> Example 6 : Doppler-shifted sound from a race car <p> ? If a race car moves at a velocity of 50 m/s , and the velocity of sound is 340 m/s , by what percentage are the wavelength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying along its line of motion ? <p> ? For an observer whom the car is approaching , we find <p> so the shift in wavelength is 15% . Since the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength for a fixed value of the speed of sound , the frequency is shifted upward by <p> i.e. , a change of 18% . ( For velocities that are small compared to the wave velocities , the Doppler shifts of the wavelength and frequency are about the same . ) <h> Example 7 : Doppler shift of the light emitted by a race car <p> ? What is the percent shift in the wavelength of the light waves emitted by a race car 's headlights ? <p> ? Looking up the speed of light in the back of the book , , we find <p> i.e. , the percentage shift is only 0.000017% . <p> The second example shows that under ordinary earthbound circumstances , Doppler shifts of light are negligible because ordinary things go so much slower than the speed of light .

The fact that they looked the same night after night meant that they were beyond the earth 's atmosphere . Not knowing what they really were , but wanting to sound official , they called them " nebulae , " a Latin word meaning " clouds " but sounding more impressive . In the early 20th century , astronomers realized that although some really were clouds of gas ( e.g. , the middle " star " of Orion 's sword , which is visibly fuzzy even to the naked eye when conditions are good ) , others were what we now call galaxies : virtual island universes consisting of trillions of stars ( for example the Andromeda Galaxy , which is visible as a fuzzy patch through binoculars ) . Three hundred years after Galileo had resolved the Milky Way into individual stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of galaxies of stars , and the Milky Way is simply the visible part of the flat disk of our own galaxy , seen from inside . <p> This opened up the scientific study of cosmology , the structure and history of the universe as a whole , a field that had not been seriously attacked since the days of Newton . Newton had realized that if gravity was always attractive , never repulsive , the universe would have a tendency to collapse . His solution to the problem was to posit a universe that was infinite and uniformly populated with matter , so that it would have no geometrical center . The gravitational forces in such a universe would always tend to cancel out by symmetry , so there would be no collapse . By the 20th century , the belief in an unchanging and infinite universe had become conventional wisdom in science , partly as a reaction against the time that had been wasted trying to find explanations of ancient geological phenomena based on catastrophes suggested by biblical events like Noah 's flood . <p> In the 1920 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light emitted by galaxies . A former college football player with a serious nicotine addiction , Hubble did not set out to change our image of the beginning of the universe . His autobiography seldom even mentions the cosmological discovery for which he is now remembered . When astronomers began to study the Doppler shifts of galaxies , they expected that each galaxy 's direction and velocity of motion would be essentially random . Some would be approaching us , and their light would therefore be Doppler-shifted to the blue end of the spectrum , while an equal number would be expected to have red shifts . What Hubble discovered instead was that except for a few very nearby ones , all the galaxies had red shifts , indicating that they were receding from us at a hefty fraction of the speed of light . Not only that , but the ones farther away were receding more quickly . The speeds were directly proportional to their distance from us . <p> Did this mean that the earth ( or at least our galaxy ) was the center of the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the relative motion of the source and the observer . If we see a distant galaxy moving away from us at 10% of the speed of light , we can be assured that the astronomers who live in that galaxy will see ours receding from them at the same speed in the opposite direction . The whole universe can be envisioned as a rising loaf of raisin bread . As the bread expands , there is more and more space between the raisins . The farther apart two raisins are , the greater the speed with which they move apart . <p> The universe 's expansion is presumably decelerating because of gravitational attraction among the galaxies . We do not presently know whether there is enough mass in the universe to cause enough attraction to halt the expansion eventually . But perhaps more interesting than the distant future of the universe is what its present expansion implies about its past . Extrapolating backward in time using the known laws of physics , the universe must have been denser and denser at earlier and earlier times . At some point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can even detect the radiation from this early fireball , in the form of microwave radiation that permeates space . The phrase Big Bang was originally coined by the doubters of the theory to make it sound ridiculous , but it stuck , and today essentially all astronomers accept the Big Bang theory based on the very direct evidence of the red shifts and the cosmic microwave background radiation . <p> Finally it should be noted what the Big Bang theory is not . It is not an explanation of why the universe exists . Such questions belong to the realm of religion , not science . Science can find ever simpler and ever more fundamental explanations for a variety of phenomena , but ultimately science takes the universe as it is according to observations . <p> Furthermore , there is an unfortunate tendency , even among many scientists , to speak of the Big Bang theory was a description of the very first event in the universe , which caused everything after it . Although it is true that time may have had a beginning ( Einstein 's theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of science can only work within a certain range of conditions such as temperature and density . Beyond a temperature of about 10 9 K , the random thermal motion of subatomic particles becomes so rapid that its velocity is comparable to the speed of light . Early enough in the history of the universe , when these temperatures existed , Newtonian physics becomes less accurate , and we must describe nature using the more general description given by Einstein 's theory of relativity , which encompasses Newtonian physics as a special case . At even higher temperatures , beyond about 10 33 degrees , physicists know that Einstein 's theory as well begins to fall apart , but we do n't know how to construct the even more general theory of nature that would work at those temperatures . No matter how far physics progresses , we will never be able to describe nature at infinitely high temperatures , since there is a limit to the temperatures we can explore by experiment and observation in order to guide us to the right theory . We are confident that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe starting a few minutes after the Big Bang , and we may be able to push back to milliseconds or microseconds after it , but we can not use the methods of science to deal with the beginning of time itself . <h> A note on Doppler shifts of light <p> If Doppler shifts depend only on the relative motion of the source and receiver , then there is no way for a person moving with the source and another person moving with the receiver to determine who is moving and who is n't . Either can blame the Doppler shift entirely on the other 's motion and claim to be at rest herself . This is entirely in agreement with the principle stated originally by Galileo that all motion is relative . <p> On the other hand , a careful analysis of the Doppler shifts of water or sound waves shows that it is only approximately true , at low speeds , that the shifts just depend on the relative motion of the source and observer . For instance , it is possible for a jet plane to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound waves appear to stand still to the pilot of the plane . The pilot then knows she is moving at exactly the speed of sound . The reason this does n't disprove the relativity of motion is that the pilot is not really determining her absolute motion but rather her motion relative to the air , which is the medium of the sound waves . <p> Einstein realized that this solved the problem for sound or water waves , but would not salvage the principle of relative motion in the case of light waves , since light is not a vibration of any physical medium such as water or air . Beginning by imagining what a beam of light would look like to a person riding a motorcycle alongside it , Einstein eventually came up with a radical new way of describing the universe , in which space and time are distorted as measured by observers in different states of motion . As a consequence of this Theory of Relativity , he showed that light waves would have Doppler shifts that would exactly , not just approximately , depend only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Discussion Questions <p> ? <p> If an airplane travels at exactly the speed of sound , what would be the wavelength of the forward-emitted part of the sound waves it emitted ? How should this be interpreted , and what would actually happen ? What happens if it 's going faster than the speed of sound ? Can you use this to explain what you see in figures aa and ab ? <p> ? <p> If bullets go slower than the speed of sound , why can a supersonic fighter plane catch up to its own sound , but not to its own bullets ? <p> ? <p> If someone inside a plane is talking to you , should their speech be Doppler shifted ? <h> 6.2 Bounded Waves <p> a / A cross-sectional view of a human body , showing the vocal tract . <p> b / Circular water waves are reflected from a boundary on the left . ( PSSC Physics ) <p> Speech is what separates humans most decisively from animals . No other species can master syntax , and even though chimpanzees can learn a vocabulary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human infant and a baby chimp : starting from birth , the human experiments with the production of complex speech sounds . <p> Since speech sounds are instinctive for us , we seldom think about them consciously . How do we control sound waves so skillfully ? Mostly we do it by changing the shape of a connected set of hollow cavities in our chest , throat , and head . Somehow by moving the boundaries of this space in and out , we can produce all the vowel sounds . Up until now , we have been studying only those properties of waves that can be understood as if they existed in an infinite , open space with no boundaries . In this chapter we address what happens when a wave is confined within a certain space , or when a wave pattern encounters the boundary between two different media , such as when a light wave moving through air encounters a glass windowpane . <p> d / An uninverted reflection . The reflected pulse is reversed front to back , but is not upside-down . <p> e / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front to back and top to bottom . <p> f / A pulse traveling through a highly absorptive medium . <h> 6.2.1 Reflection , transmission , and absorption <h> Reflection and transmission <p> Sound waves can echo back from a cliff , and light waves are reflected from the surface of a pond . We use the word reflection , normally applied only to light waves in ordinary speech , to describe any such case of a wave rebounding from a barrier . Figure ( a ) shows a circular water wave being reflected from a straight wall . In this chapter , we will concentrate mainly on reflection of waves that move in one dimension , as in figure c /1 . <p> Wave reflection does not surprise us . After all , a material object such as a rubber ball would bounce back in the same way . But waves are not objects , and there are some surprises in store . <p> First , only part of the wave is usually reflected . Looking out through a window , we see light waves that passed through it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her reflection in the glass . A light wave that strikes the glass is partly reflected and partly transmitted ( passed ) by the glass . The energy of the original wave is split between the two . This is different from the behavior of the rubber ball , which must go one way or the other , not both . <p> Second , consider what you see if you are swimming underwater and you look up at the surface . You see your own reflection . This is utterly counterintuitive , since we would expect the light waves to burst forth to freedom in the wide-open air . A material projectile shot up toward the surface would never rebound from the water-air boundary ! <p> What is it about the difference between two media that causes waves to be partly reflected at the boundary between them ? Is it their density ? Their chemical composition ? Ultimately all that matters is the speed of the wave in the two media . A wave is partially reflected and partially transmitted at the boundary between media in which it has different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in window glass is about 30% less than in air , which explains why windows always make reflections . Figure c shows examples of wave pulses being reflected at the boundary between two coil springs of different weights , in which the wave speed is different . <p> c / 1 . A wave on a coil spring , initially traveling to the left , is reflected from the fixed end . 2 . A wave in the lighter spring , where the wave speed is greater , travels to the left and is then partly reflected and partly transmitted at the boundary with the heavier coil spring , which has a lower wave speed . The reflection is inverted . 3 . A wave moving to the right in the heavier spring is partly reflected at the boundary with the lighter spring . The reflection is uninverted . ( PSSC Physics ) <p> Reflections such as b and c /1 , where a wave encounters a massive fixed object , can usually be understood on the same basis as cases like c /2 and c /3 where two media meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more extreme version of example c /2 . If the heavy coil spring in c /2 was made heavier and heavier , it would end up acting like the fixed wall to which the light spring in c /1 has been attached . <p> self-check : <p> In figure c /1 , the reflected pulse is upside-down , but its depth is just as big as the original pulse 's height . How does the energy of the reflected pulse compare with that of the original ? <p> ( answer in the back of the PDF version of the book ) <h> Example 8 : Fish have internal ears . <p> Why do n't fish have ear-holes ? The speed of sound waves in a fish 's body is not much different from their speed in water , so sound waves are not strongly reflected from a fish 's skin . They pass right through its body , so fish can have internal ears . <h> Example 9 : Whale songs traveling long distances <p> Sound waves travel at drastically different speeds through rock , water , and air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom and the surface . The sound waves can travel hundreds of miles , bouncing repeatedly between the bottom and the surface , and still be detectable . Sadly , noise pollution from ships has nearly shut down this cetacean version of the internet . <h> Example 10 : Long-distance radio communication <p> Radio communication can occur between stations on opposite sides of the planet . The mechanism is entirely similar to the one explained in the previous example , but the three media involved are the earth , the atmosphere , and the ionosphere . <p> self-check : <p> Sonar is a method for ships and submarines to detect each other by producing sound waves and listening for echoes . What properties would an underwater object have to have in order to be invisible to sonar ? <p> ( answer in the back of the PDF version of the book ) <p> The use of the word " reflection " naturally brings to mind the creation of an image by a mirror , but this might be confusing , because we do not normally refer to " reflection " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reflection is how we see the surfaces of all objects , not just polished ones . When we look at a sidewalk , for example , we are actually seeing the reflecting of the sun from the concrete . The reason we do n't see an image of the sun at our feet is simply that the rough surface blurs the image so drastically . <h> Inverted and uninverted reflections <p> Notice how the pulse reflected back to the right in example c /2 comes back upside-down , whereas the one reflected back to the left in c /3 returns in its original upright form . This is true for other waves as well . In general , there are two possible types of reflections , a reflection back into a faster medium and a reflection back into a slower medium . One type will always be an inverting reflection and one noninverting . <p> It 's important to realize that when we discuss inverted and uninverted reflections on a string , we are talking about whether the wave is flipped across the direction of motion ( i.e. , upside-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reversed front to back , as shown in figures d and e . This is because it is traveling in the other direction . The leading edge of the pulse is what gets reflected first , so it is still ahead when it starts back to the left --- it 's just that " ahead " is now in the opposite direction . <h> Absorption <p> So far we have tacitly assumed that wave energy remains as wave energy , and is not converted to any other form . If this was true , then the world would become more and more full of sound waves , which could never escape into the vacuum of outer space . In reality , any mechanical wave consists of a traveling pattern of vibrations of some physical medium , and vibrations of matter always produce heat , as when you bend a coathangar back and forth and it becomes hot . We can thus expect that in mechanical waves such as water waves , sound waves , or waves on a string , the wave energy will gradually be converted into heat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wave 's energy can also be described as a reduction in amplitude , the relationship between them being , as with a vibrating object , E ? A 2 . <p> The wave suffers a decrease in amplitude , as shown in figure f . The decrease in amplitude amounts to the same fractional change for each unit of distance covered . For example , if a wave decreases from amplitude 2 to amplitude 1 over a distance of 1 meter , then after traveling another meter it will have an amplitude of 1/2 . That is , the reduction in amplitude is exponential . This can be proved as follows . By the principle of superposition , we know that a wave of amplitude 2 must behave like the superposition of two identical waves of amplitude 1 . If a single amplitude-1 wave would die down to amplitude 1/2 over a certain distance , then two amplitude-1 waves superposed on top of one another to make amplitude 1+1=2 must die down to amplitude 1/2+1/2=1 over the same distance . <p> self-check : <p> As a wave undergoes absorption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ? <p> ( answer in the back of the PDF version of the book ) <p> In many cases , this frictional heating effect is quite weak . Sound waves in air , for instance , dissipate into heat extremely slowly , and the sound of church music in a cathedral may reverberate for as much as 3 or 4 seconds before it becomes inaudible . During this time it has traveled over a kilometer ! Even this very gradual dissipation of energy occurs mostly as heating of the church 's walls and by the leaking of sound to the outside ( where it will eventually end up as heat ) . Under the right conditions ( humid air and low frequency ) , a sound wave in a straight pipe could theoretically travel hundreds of kilometers before being noticeable attenuated . <p> In general , the absorption of mechanical waves depends a great deal on the chemical composition and microscopic structure of the medium . Ripples on the surface of antifreeze , for instance , die out extremely rapidly compared to ripples on water . For sound waves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the viscosity of the substance , i.e. , whether it flows easily like water or mercury or more sluggishly like molasses or antifreeze . This explains why our intuitive expectation of strong absorption of sound in water is incorrect . Water is a very weak absorber of sound ( viz. whale songs and sonar ) , and our incorrect intuition arises from focusing on the wrong property of the substance : water 's high density , which is irrelevant , rather than its low viscosity , which is what matters . <p> Light is an interesting case , since although it can travel through matter , it is not itself a vibration of any material substance . Thus we can look at the star Sirius , 10 14 km away from us , and be assured that none of its light was absorbed in the vacuum of outer space during its 9-year journey to us . The Hubble Space Telescope routinely observes light that has been on its way to us since the early history of the universe , billions of years ago . Of course the energy of light can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light from distant galaxies is often absorbed if there happen to be clouds of gas or dust in between ) . <h> Example 11 : Soundproofing <p> Typical amateur musicians setting out to soundproof their garages tend to think that they should simply cover the walls with the densest possible substance . In fact , sound is not absorbed very strongly even by passing through several inches of wood . A better strategy for soundproofing is to create a sandwich of alternating layers of materials in which the speed of sound is very different , to encourage reflection . <p> The classic design is alternating layers of fiberglass and plywood . The speed of sound in plywood is very high , due to its stiffness , while its speed in fiberglass is essentially the same as its speed in air . Both materials are fairly good sound absorbers , but sound waves passing through a few inches of them are still not going to be absorbed sufficiently . The point of combining them is that a sound wave that tries to get out will be strongly reflected at each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times like a ping pong ball . Due to all the back-and-forth motion , the sound may end up traveling a total distance equal to ten times the actual thickness of the soundproofing before it escapes . This is the equivalent of having ten times the thickness of sound-absorbing material . <h> Example 12 : Radio transmission <p> A radio transmitting station must have a length of wire or cable connecting the amplifier to the antenna . The cable and the antenna act as two different media for radio waves , and there will therefore be partial reflection of the waves as they come from the cable to the antenna . If the waves bounce back and forth many times between the amplifier and the antenna , a great deal of their energy will be absorbed . There are two ways to attack the problem . One possibility is to design the antenna so that the speed of the waves in it is as close as possible to the speed of the waves in the cable ; this minimizes the amount of reflection . The other method is to connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cable that does not strongly absorb the waves . Partial reflection then becomes irrelevant , since all the wave energy will eventually exit through the antenna . <h> Discussion Questions <p> ? <p> A sound wave that underwent a pressure-inverting reflection would have its compressions converted to expansions and vice versa . How would its energy and frequency compare with those of the original sound ? Would it sound any different ? What happens if you swap the two wires where they connect to a stereo speaker , resulting in waves that vibrate in the opposite way ? <p> g / 1 . A change in frequency without a change in wavelength would produce a discontinuity in the wave . 2 . A simple change in wavelength without a reflection would result in a sharp kink in the wave . <p> h / A pulse being partially reflected and partially transmitted at the boundary between two strings in which the wave speed is different . The top drawing shows the pulse heading to the right , toward the heaver string . For clarity , all but the first and last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerge from the boundary , it adds together with the trailing parts of the incident pulse . Their sum , shown as a wider line , is what is actually observed . <p> i / A wave pattern in freeway traffic . <p> j / In the mirror image , the areas of positive excess traffic density are still positive , but the velocities of the cars have all been reversed , so areas of positive excess velocity have been turned into negative ones . <p> k / A pulse encounters two boundaries . <p> l / A sine wave has been reflected at two different boundaries , and the two reflections interfere . <h> 6.2.2 Quantitative treatment of reflection <p> In this subsection we analyze the reasons why reflections occur at a speed-changing boundary , predict quantitatively the intensities of reflection and transmission , and discuss how to predict for any type of wave which reflections are inverting and which are uninverting . <h> Why reflection occurs <p> To understand the fundamental reasons for what does occur at the boundary between media , let 's first discuss what does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinusoidal wave on a string . If the wave progresses from a heavier portion of the string , in which its velocity is low , to a lighter-weight part , in which it is high , then the equation v = f ? tells us that it must change its frequency , or its wavelength , or both . If only the frequency changed , then the parts of the wave in the two different portions of the string would quickly get out of step with each other , producing a discontinuity in the wave , g /1 . This is unphysical , so we know that the wavelength must change while the frequency remains constant , g /2 . <p> But there is still something unphysical about figure g /2 . The sudden change in the shape of the wave has resulted in a sharp kink at the boundary . This ca n't really happen , because the medium tends to accelerate in such a way as to eliminate curvature . A sharp kink corresponds to an infinite curvature at one point , which would produce an infinite acceleration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave motion envisioned in fig. g /2 . Waves can have kinks , but not stationary kinks . <p> We conclude that without positing partial reflection of the wave , we can not simultaneously satisfy the requirements of ( 1 ) continuity of the wave , and ( 2 ) no sudden changes in the slope of the wave . In other words , we assume that both the wave and its derivative are continuous functions . ) <p> Does this amount to a proof that reflection occurs ? Not quite . We have only proved that certain types of wave motion are not valid solutions . In the following subsection , we prove that a valid solution can always be found in which a reflection occurs . Now in physics , we normally assume ( but seldom prove formally ) that the equations of motion have a unique solution , since otherwise a given set of initial conditions could lead to different behavior later on , but the Newtonian universe is supposed to be deterministic . Since the solution must be unique , and we derive below a valid solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what amounts to a proof of reflection . <h> Intensity of reflection <p> I will now show , in the case of waves on a string , that it is possible to satisfy the physical requirements given above by constructing a reflected wave , and as a bonus this will produce an equation for the proportions of reflection and transmission and a prediction as to which conditions will lead to inverted and which to uninverted reflection . We assume only that the principle of superposition holds , which is a good approximations for waves on a string of sufficiently small amplitude . <p> Let the unknown amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves be R and T , respectively . An inverted reflection would be represented by a negative value of R . We can without loss of generality take the incident ( original ) wave to have unit amplitude . Superposition tells us that if , for instance , the incident wave had double this amplitude , we could immediately find a corresponding solution simply by doubling R and T . <p> Just to the left of the boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height 1 of the incident wave , plus the height R of the part of the reflected wave that has just been created and begun heading back , for a total height of 1+ R . On the right side immediately next to the boundary , the transmitted wave has a height T . To avoid a discontinuity , we must have <p> 1+ R = T . <p> Next we turn to the requirement of equal slopes on both sides of the boundary . Let the slope of the incoming wave be s immediately to the left of the junction . If the wave was 100% reflected , and without inversion , then the slope of the reflected wave would be - s , since the wave has been reversed in direction . In general , the slope of the reflected wave equals - sR , and the slopes of the superposed waves on the left side add up to s - sR . On the right , the slope depends on the amplitude , T , but is also changed by the stretching or compression of the wave due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wave speed is twice as great on the right side , then the slope is cut in half by this effect . The slope on the right is therefore s ( v 1 / v 2 ) T , where v 1 is the velocity in the original medium and v 2 the velocity in the new medium . Equality of slopes gives s - sR = s ( v 1 / v 2 ) T , or <p> Solving the two equations for the unknowns R and T gives <p> The first equation shows that there is no reflection unless the two wave speeds are different , and that the reflection is inverted in reflection back into a fast medium . <p> The energies of the transmitted and reflected wavers always add up to the same as the energy of the original wave . There is never any abrupt loss ( or gain ) in energy when a wave crosses a boundary ; conversion of wave energy to heat occurs for many types of waves , but it occurs throughout the medium . The equation for T , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be greater than 1 , i.e. , greater than that of the incident wave . This does not violate conservation of energy , because this occurs when the second string is less massive , reducing its kinetic energy , and the transmitted pulse is broader and less strongly curved , which lessens its potential energy . <h> Inverted and uninverted reflections in general ( optional ) <p> For waves on a string , reflections back into a faster medium are inverted , while those back into a slower medium are uninverted . Is this true for all types of waves ? The rather subtle answer is that it depends on what property of the wave you are discussing . <p> Let 's start by considering wave disturbances of freeway traffic . Anyone who has driven frequently on crowded freeways has observed the phenomenon in which one driver taps the brakes , starting a chain reaction that travels backward down the freeway as each person in turn exercises caution in order to avoid rear-ending anyone . The reason why this type of wave is relevant is that it gives a simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which aspect of the wave we have in mind . In steadily flowing freeway traffic , both the density of cars and their velocity are constant all along the road . Since there is no disturbance in this pattern of constant velocity and density , we say that there is no wave . Now if a wave is touched off by a person tapping the brakes , we can either describe it as a region of high density or as a region of decreasing velocity . <p> The freeway traffic wave is in fact a good model of a sound wave , and a sound wave can likewise be described either by the density ( or pressure ) of the air or by its speed . Likewise many other types of waves can be described by either of two functions , one of which is often the derivative of the other with respect to position . <p> Now let 's consider reflections . If we observe the freeway wave in a mirror , the high-density area will still appear high in density , but velocity in the opposite direction will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observing the mirror image will draw the same density graph , but the velocity graph will be flipped across the x axis , and its original region of negative slope will now have positive slope . Although I do n't know any physical situation that would correspond to the reflection of a traffic wave , we can immediately apply the same reasoning to sound waves , which often do get reflected , and determine that a reflection can either be density-inverting and velocity-uninverting or density-uninverting and velocity-inverting . <p> This same type of situation will occur over and over as one encounters new types of waves , and to apply the analogy we need only determine which quantities , like velocity , become negated in a mirror image and which , like density , stay the same . <p> A light wave , for instance consists of a traveling pattern of electric and magnetic fields . All you need to know in order to analyze the reflection of light waves is how electric and magnetic fields behave under reflection ; you do n't need to know any of the detailed physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detected , for example , by the way one 's hair stands on end . The direction of the hair indicates the direction of the electric field . In a mirror image , the hair points the other way , so the electric field is apparently reversed in a mirror image . The behavior of magnetic fields , however , is a little tricky . The magnetic properties of a bar magnet , for instance , are caused by the aligned rotation of the outermost orbiting electrons of the atoms . In a mirror image , the direction of rotation is reversed , say from clockwise to counterclockwise , and so the magnetic field is reversed twice : once simply because the whole picture is flipped and once because of the reversed rotation of the electrons . In other words , magnetic fields do not reverse themselves in a mirror image . We can thus predict that there will be two possible types of reflection of light waves . In one , the electric field is inverted and the magnetic field uninverted . In the other , the electric field is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pulse bounces back and forth . <p> n / We model a guitar string attached to the guitar 's body at both ends as a light-weight string attached to extremely heavy strings at its ends . <h> 6.2.3 Interference effects <p> If you look at the front of a pair of high-quality binoculars , you will notice a greenish-blue coating on the lenses . This is advertised as a coating to prevent reflection . Now reflection is clearly undesirable --- we want the light to go in the binoculars --- but so far I 've described reflection as an unalterable fact of nature , depending only on the properties of the two wave media . The coating ca n't change the speed of light in air or in glass , so how can it work ? The key is that the coating itself is a wave medium . In other words , we have a three-layer sandwich of materials : air , coating , and glass . We will analyze the way the coating works , not because optical coatings are an important part of your education but because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference effects . <p> There are two different interfaces between media : an air-coating boundary and a coating-glass boundary . Partial reflection and partial transmission will occur at each boundary . For ease of visualization let 's start by considering an equivalent system consisting of three dissimilar pieces of string tied together , and a wave pattern consisting initially of a single pulse . Figure k /1 shows the incident pulse moving through the heavy rope , in which its velocity is low . When it encounters the lighter-weight rope in the middle , a faster medium , it is partially reflected and partially transmitted . ( The transmitted pulse is bigger , but nevertheless has only part of the original energy . ) The pulse transmitted by the first interface is then partially reflected and partially transmitted by the second boundary , k /3 . In figure k /4 , two pulses are on the way back out to the left , and a single pulse is heading off to the right . ( There is still a weak pulse caught between the two boundaries , and this will rattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it leaks energy to the outside with each partial reflection . ) <p> Note how , of the two reflected pulses in k /4 , one is inverted and one uninverted . One underwent reflection at the first boundary ( a reflection back into a slower medium is uninverted ) , but the other was reflected at the second boundary ( reflection back into a faster medium is inverted ) . <p> Now let 's imagine what would have happened if the incoming wave pattern had been a long sinusoidal wave train instead of a single pulse . The first two waves to reemerge on the left could be in phase , l /1 , or out of phase , l /2 , or anywhere in between . The amount of lag between them depends entirely on the width of the middle segment of string .

The only real difference between the waves-on-a-rope example and the case of an optical coating is that the first and third media are air and glass , in which light does not have the same speed . However , the general result is the same as long as the air and the glass have light-wave speeds that either both greater than the coating 's or both less than the coating 's . <p> The business of optical coatings turns out to be a very arcane one , with a plethora of trade secrets and " black magic " techniques handed down from master to apprentice . Nevertheless , the ideas you have learned about waves in general are sufficient to allow you to come to some definite conclusions without any further technical knowledge .

With a little guidance , you are now ready to figure out for yourself other examples such as the rainbow pattern made by a compact disc or by a layer of oil on a puddle . <h> Discussion Questions <p> ? <p> Is it possible to get complete destructive interference in an optical coating , at least for light of one specific wavelength ? <p> ? <p> Sunlight consists of sinusoidal wave-trains containing on the order of a hundred cycles back-to-back , for a length of something like a tenth of a millimeter . What happens if you try to make an optical coating thicker than this ? <p> ? <p> Suppose you take two microscope slides and lay one on top of the other so that one of its edges is resting on the corresponding edge of the bottom one . If you insert a sliver of paper or a hair at the opposite end , a wedge-shaped layer of air will exist in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to the other . What would you expect to see if the slides were illuminated from above by light of a single color ? How would this change if you gradually lifted the lower edge of the top slide until the two slides were finally parallel ? <p> ? <p> An observation like the one described in discussion question C was used by Newton as evidence against the wave theory of light ! If Newton did n't know about inverting and noninverting reflections , what would have seemed inexplicable to him about the region where the air layer had zero or nearly zero thickness ? <p> o / The period of this double-pulse pattern is half of what we 'd otherwise expect . <p> p / Any wave can be made by superposing sine waves . <p> q / Graphs of loudness versus frequency for the vowel " ah , " sung as three different musical notes .

The same is not true for a square wave . <p> t / Surprisingly , sound waves undergo partial reflection at the open ends of tubes as well as closed ones . <p> u / Graphs of excess density versus position for the lowest-frequency standing waves of three types of air columns . Points on the axis have normal air density . <p> v / A pan pipe is an asymmetric air column , open at the top and closed at the bottom . <p> w / A concert flute looks like an asymmetric air column , open at the mouth end and closed at the other . However , its patterns of vibration are symmetric , because the embouchure hole acts like an open end . <h> 6.2.4 Waves bounded on both sides <p> In the example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pulse would be trapped permanently in the middle medium , but that pulse was not central to our discussion , and in any case it was weakening severely with each partial reflection . Now consider a guitar string . At its ends it is tied to the body of the instrument itself , and since the body is very massive , the behavior of the waves when they reach the end of the string can be understood in the same way as if the actual guitar string was attached on the ends to strings that were extremely massive . Reflections are most intense when the two media are very dissimilar . Because the wave speed in the body is so radically different from the speed in the string , we should expect nearly 100% reflection . <p> Although this may seem like a rather bizarre physical model of the actual guitar string , it already tells us something interesting about the behavior of a guitar that we would not otherwise have understood . The body , far from being a passive frame for attaching the strings to , is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With every reflection , the wave pattern on the string loses a tiny fraction of its energy , which is then conducted through the body and out into the air . ( The string has too little cross-section to make sound waves efficiently by itself . ) By changing the properties of the body , moreover , we should expect to have an effect on the manner in which sound escapes from the instrument . This is clearly demonstrated by the electric guitar , which has an extremely massive , solid wooden body . Here the dissimilarity between the two wave media is even more pronounced , with the result that wave energy leaks out of the string even more slowly . This is why an electric guitar with no electric pickup can hardly be heard at all , and it is also the reason why notes on an electric guitar can be sustained for longer than notes on an acoustic guitar . <p> If we initially create a disturbance on a guitar string , how will the reflections behave ? In reality , the finger or pick will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we may think of this triangular shape as a very broad " dent " in the string which will spread out in both directions . For simplicity , however , let 's just imagine a wave pattern that initially consists of a single , narrow pulse traveling up the neck , m /1 . After reflection from the top end , it is inverted , m /3 . Now something interesting happens : figure m /5 is identical to figure m /1 . After two reflections , the pulse has been inverted twice and has changed direction twice . It is now back where it started . The motion is periodic . This is why a guitar produces sounds that have a definite sensation of pitch . <p> self-check : <p> Notice that from m /1 to m /5 , the pulse has passed by every point on the string exactly twice . This means that the total distance it has traveled equals 2 L , where L is the length of the string . Given this fact , what are the period and frequency of the sound it produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velocity of the wave ? <p> ( answer in the back of the PDF version of the book ) <p> Note that if the waves on the string obey the principle of superposition , then the velocity must be independent of amplitude , and the guitar will produce the same pitch regardless of whether it is played loudly or softly . In reality , waves on a string obey the principle of superposition approximately , but not exactly . The guitar , like just about any acoustic instrument , is a little out of tune when played loudly . ( The effect is more pronounced for wind instruments than for strings , but wind players are able to compensate for it . ) <p> Now there is only one hole in our reasoning . Suppose we somehow arrange to have an initial setup consisting of two identical pulses heading toward each other , as in figure ( g ) . They will pass through each other , undergo a single inverting reflection , and come back to a configuration in which their positions have been exactly interchanged . This means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency is twice as high . <p> This might seem like a purely academic possibility , since nobody actually plays the guitar with two picks at once ! But in fact it is an example of a very general fact about waves that are bounded on both sides . A mathematical theorem called Fourier 's theorem states that any wave can be created by superposing sine waves . Figure p shows how even by using only four sine waves with appropriately chosen amplitudes , we can arrive at a sum which is a decent approximation to the realistic triangular shape of a guitar string being plucked . The one-hump wave , in which half a wavelength fits on the string , will behave like the single pulse we originally discussed . We call its frequency f o . The two-hump wave , with one whole wavelength , is very much like the two-pulse example . For the reasons discussed above , its frequency is 2 f o . Similarly , the three-hump and four-hump waves have frequencies of 3 f o and 4 f o . <p> Theoretically we would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial triangular shape of the string exactly , although the amplitudes required for the very high frequency parts would be very small , and an excellent approximation could be achieved with as few as ten waves . <p> We thus arrive at the following very general conclusion . Whenever a wave pattern exists in a medium bounded on both sides by media in which the wave speed is very different , the motion can be broken down into the motion of a ( theoretically infinite ) series of sine waves , with frequencies f o , 2 f o , 3 f o , ... Except for some technical details , to be discussed below , this analysis applies to a vast range of sound-producing systems , including the air column within the human vocal tract . Because sounds composed of this kind of pattern of frequencies are so common , our ear-brain system has evolved so as to perceive them as a single , fused sensation of tone . <h> Musical applications <p> Many musicians claim to be able to pick out by ear several of the frequencies 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtones or harmonics of the fundamental f o , but they are kidding themselves . In reality , the overtone series has two important roles in music , neither of which depends on this fictitious ability to " hear out " the individual overtones . <p> First , the relative strengths of the overtones is an important part of the personality of a sound , called its timbre ( rhymes with " amber " ) . The characteristic tone of the brass instruments , for example , is a sound that starts out with a very strong harmonic series extending up to very high frequencies , but whose higher harmonics die down drastically as the attack changes to the sustained portion of the note . <p> Second , although the ear can not separate the individual harmonics of a single musical tone , it is very sensitive to clashes between the overtones of notes played simultaneously , i.e. , in harmony . We tend to perceive a combination of notes as being dissonant if they have overtones that are close but not the same . Roughly speaking , strong overtones whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause the notes to sound dissonant . It is important to realize that the term " dissonance " is not a negative one in music . No matter how long you search the radio dial , you will never hear more than three seconds of music without at least one dissonant combination of notes . Dissonance is a necessary ingredient in the creation of a musical cycle of tension and release . Musically knowledgeable people do not usually use the word " dissonant " as a criticism of music , and if they do , what they are really saying is that the dissonance has been used in a clumsy way , or without providing any contrast between dissonance and consonance . <p> s / Standing waves on a rope . ( PSSC Physics . ) <h> Standing waves <p> Figure s shows sinusoidal wave patterns made by shaking a rope . I used to enjoy doing this at the bank with the pens on chains , back in the days when people actually went to the bank . You might think that I and the person in the photos had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such nice sine waves . In fact , a sine wave is the only shape that can create this kind of wave pattern , called a standing wave , which simply vibrates back and forth in one place without moving . The sine wave just creates itself automatically when you find the right frequency , because no other shape is possible . <p> If you think about it , it 's not even obvious that sine waves should be able to do this trick . After all , waves are supposed to travel at a set speed , are n't they ? The speed is n't supposed to be zero ! Well , we can actually think of a standing wave as a superposition of a moving sine wave with its own reflection , which is moving the opposite way . Sine waves have the unique mathematical property that the sum of sine waves of equal wavelength is simply a new sine wave with the same wavelength . As the two sine waves go back and forth , they always cancel perfectly at the ends , and their sum appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since atoms are really standing-wave patterns of electron waves . You are a standing wave ! <h> Standing-wave patterns of air columns <p> The air column inside a wind instrument behaves very much like the wave-on-a-string example we 've been concentrating on so far , the main difference being that we may have either inverting or noninverting reflections at the ends . <p> Some organ pipes are closed at both ends . The speed of sound is different in metal than in air , so there is a strong reflection at the closed ends , and we can have standing waves . These reflections are both density-noninverting , so we get symmetric standing-wave patterns , such as the one shown in figure u /1 . <p> Figure t shows the sound waves in and around a bamboo Japanese flute called a shakuhachi , which is open at both ends of the air column . We can only have a standing wave pattern if there are reflections at the ends , but that is very counterintuitive --- why is there any reflection at all , if the sound wave is free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in medium ? Recall the reason why we got reflections at a change in medium : because the wavelength changes , so the wave has to readjust itself from one pattern to another , and the only way it can do that without developing a kink is if there is a reflection . Something similar is happening here . The only difference is that the wave is adjusting from being a plane wave to being a spherical wave . The reflections at the open ends are density-inverting , u /2 , so the wave pattern is pinched off at the ends . Comparing panels 1 and 2 of the figure , we see that although the wave pattens are different , in both cases the wavelength is the same : in the lowest-frequency standing wave , half a wavelength fits inside the tube . Thus , it is n't necessary to memorize which type of reflection is inverting and which is inverting . It 's only necessary to know that the tubes are symmetric . <p> Finally , we can have an asymmetric tube : closed at one end and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan pipes , v , which are closed at the bottom and open at the top . The standing wave with the lowest frequency is therefore one in which 1/4 of a wavelength fits along the length of the tube , as shown in figure u /3 . <p> Sometimes an instrument 's physical appearance can be misleading . A concert flute , w , is closed at the mouth end and open at the other , so we would expect it to behave like an asymmetric air column ; in reality , it behaves like a symmetric air column open at both ends , because the embouchure hole ( the hole the player blows over ) acts like an open end . The clarinet and the saxophone look similar , having a moutpiece and reed at one end and an open end at the other , but they act different . In fact the clarinet 's air column has patterns of vibration that are asymmetric , the saxophone symmetric . The discrepancy comes from the difference between the conical tube of the sax and the cylindrical tube of the clarinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave to a spherical wave is more gradual at the flaring bell of the saxophone . <p> self-check : <p> Draw a graph of pressure versus position for the first overtone of the air column in a tube open at one end and closed at the other . This will be the next-to-longest possible wavelength that allows for a point of maximum vibration at one end and a point of no vibration at the other . How many times shorter will its wavelength be compared to the frequency of the lowest-frequency standing wave , shown in the figure ? Based on this , how many times greater will its frequency be ? <p> ( answer in the back of the PDF version of the book ) <h> Example 13 : The speed of sound <p> We can get a rough and ready derivation of the equation for the speed of sound by analyzing the standing waves in a cylindrical air column as a special type of Helmholtz resonance ( example 25 on page 330 ) , in which the cavity happens to have the same cross-sectional area as the neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the cavity . The regions of minimum density variation , on the other hand , are the places where the velocity of the air is varying the most ; these regions throttle back the speed of the vibration , because of the inertia of the moving air . If the cylinder has cross-sectional area A , then the " cavity " and " neck " parts of the wave both have lengths of something like ? /2 , and the volume of the " cavity " is about A ? /2 . We get , where the factor ( ... ) represents numerical stuff that we ca n't possibly hope to have gotten right with such a crude argument . The correct result is in fact .

In addition to a $40,000 business loan I had raked up 3 credit cards to total $32,000 . Additionally , out of desperation I had borrowed even more from former clients and family members .

I then assumed it was because my cards were nearly maxed out , but years later when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my credit report that had caused this issue . I researched how to resolve the error but by that time it had cost me hundreds of dollars worth of interest per year .

So it seems fitting to share my TEDx talk this week , one that was filmed here in Santa Cruz and which I have since taken around the world . The theme of TEDxSantaCruz was " Open . " It gave me a chance to really think about how we have been opening up our museum and what it means for our community . Doing this talk was an incredible experience , both because of the warm and energized response I received at the event and because the format forced me to hone in on what 's most important to me these days and share it in a succinct way . <p> It 's only 15 minutes , so I encourage you to watch it , but here are the crib notes for the video-adverse without the hilarious stories and charming photographs . <p> Museums can be incredible catalysts for social change . But they 're not there yet . Right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of our population . We can change that by embracing participatory culture and opening up to the active , social ways that people engage with art , history , science , and ideas today . We 're doing it in Santa Cruz and it has absolutely transformed our museum into a thriving community institution . <p> The first way we open up is by inviting active participation . We see every visitor who walks in the door as a contributor who can make our museum better . We seek and encourage collaboration with diverse groups and individuals in our community , and we develop ways for people to contribute in both immediate and long-term ways . <p> I know that not all public participation is substantive . I believe that everyone has the ability to contribute something powerful , and everyone also has the ability to be an idiot . The difference in what we contribute is in the design of the invitation conferred onto us . At the MAH , we carefully design invitations to participate to convey a high level of respect and value for what visitors bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bringing their best selves forward , sharing powerful creative work and personal stories . The result makes our museum more vibrant and multi-vocal , and it creates a powerful sense of ownership in our community . <p> The second way we open up is by treating our artifacts as social objects that can mediate interactions among people from different backgrounds . We 've all seen how a pet dog can connect two strangers despite the social barriers that abound . How can we make museum objects more like dogs ? How can we use our artifacts to activate important conversations about the future of our communities ? At the MAH , we do this by designing thoughtful opportunities for interaction around artifacts , so that visitors see them less as holy objects and more as starting points for dialogue . And when we do it right , this approach brings people together across social division towards something approaching understanding and mutual respect . <p> This combination--inviting active participation , treating museum objects as locuses of important conversations--makes our museum a more relevant , essential community space . This is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the world that are reinventing themselves as spaces for making and sharing , and in doing so , are fulfilling their public missions . <p> For me , the mission that is most compelling is the goal to build social cohesion by bringing people together across differences . We live in such a divided world . It is increasingly difficult to find opportunities to engage with people who are truly different from us in a positive way . If museums can build those social bridges , then we 're not just doing great work for our institutions . We 're doing great work for our communities , too . <p> Thanks to everyone who I met in the past weeks who has inspired and challenged me based on this talk . And thanks especially to the folks at TEDxSantaCruz who got it going and made this fabulous video . On that note , if you 're interested in open data , I highly recommend Martha Mendoza 's talk from that same event on FOIA requests and journalism--very powerful stuff . <h> Wednesday , November 07 , 2012 <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oslo , Denver , Charlotte , and Roanoke ( join the NAMP livestream on Sunday at 9:25am PT here ) . I 'm thrilled to share this brilliant guest post by Marilyn Russell , Curator of Education at the Carnegie Museum of Art . In a straightforward way , Marilyn explains how her team developed a participatory project to improve engagement in a gallery with an awkward entry . This is a perfect example of a museum using participation as a design solution . This post appears here in excerpted form ; you can read the whole story here . <h> THE CHALLENGE <p> Carnegie Museum of Art director Lynn Zelevansky challenged us to find a way to overcome a major practical problem with our Forum Gallery space : how to get visitors to enter a gallery that is often obscured by a large wall that blocks the light from the large lobby windows nearby . We also wanted to : <p> Inspire visitors to engage in active looking : notice , reflect , react , and respond to the works of art and to the interdisciplinary quality of the exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forum Gallery by motivating visitors to share their own ideas and interpretations of the artwork with other visitors in physical and virtual formats . This coincides with the identification of 20- and 30-year-olds as an audience targeted for growth in attendance . <p> What could we put in the lobby just outside the gallery to : <p> Capture the attention of visitors and alert them to the exhibition behind the wall ? <p> Offer something fun and appealing to do that required entering the exhibition ? <p> Inspire visitors to look , think , and respond actively to the works on view ? <h> SOLUTION : POST-IT NOTES ? YES . <p> We wondered how to bring their reactions of the artworks from the gallery to the activity space in the lobby , and offer visitors some control over their interactions with the artworks . We decided to select 12 individual works of art from the exhibition , reproduce them as 2.5 x 2.5-inch post-it notes , and attach a stack of the small reproductions on the wall next to each related original work . ( Who does n't like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used as the source material for visitors ' creative responses , allowing them to get their hands on the images--manipulating and modifying the works into something new . The activity was facilitated by the activity station set up in the lobby just outside the gallery . There , visitors encountered a large table with a long horizontal display board featuring a call to action at the top to PERUSE and PARTICIPATE . <p> A friendly museum educator stood near the table to greet curious visitors ; offer them one of five prompt sheets , a clip board , and colored pencils ; and invite them into the gallery to begin their exploration . In the gallery , visitors enjoyed the art and selected one or more post-it reproductions and " curated " their arrangement on their prompt sheets adding captions , drawings , narrative--whatever the works of art inspired . We tested five versions of the prompt sheets--some with instructions focused to the subject of the exhibition ( artists ' takes on nature ) , others with more open-ended instructions designed to encourage a broader range of responses . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of responses we received on our Facebook page . We posted completed prompt sheets on the display board with magnets and eventually provided stars and thumbs-up magnets for visitors who preferred responding to the work of other visitors to doing one themselves . We continually posted new completed sheets on our Facebook page and encouraged visitors to post them on their personal social media pages . In addition to the display board of recently completed sheets , we collected older sheets in two large binders for visitors to flip through , and placed one in the gallery and another at the table . <p> Our colleagues in the Museum of Natural History were eager collaborators . Together we identified locations in their galleries that resonated with the 12 focus works in the Forum exhibition . The scientific staff wrote and installed label texts in their galleries about the works of art from their perspectives . We provided a guide to these locations for visitors at the activity table . <h> VISITOR TESTIMONIALS <p> Over the weeks of the exhibition , visitors jotted down comments in a notebook at the activity table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , super interactive , engaging ! " <p> " It is great to feel more of a part of the museum ! " <p> " All the artworks should have stickies . " <p> " This was transformational ! Thank you so much ! I hope more museums do things like this . How wonderful to be able to respond to art , to peruse and then participate instead of just keeping it all inside ! ! " --An English teacher <p> " It is a very great way for kids to connect art &; nature ... however it was a bit difficult for a 6-year-old to understand . ( She did it anyway . ) How about break it down for younger children ? " <p> " What a wonderful resource for classes . " --A University of Pittsburgh professor <p> " People who did the responses are older than I expected . " --A college student <p> " I really like the post-its . I 'm surprised I have n't seen something like this in other museums . " <p> " I like that the art response of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . are so similar . " --A college student <p> " We loved the post-it sticker idea , that way we can still share the artwork at home . " --A mom &; 2 small kids <p> " Great exhibit .... post-it notes are great for children to participate and remember . " <h> LEARNING <p> The post-it activity achieved our goals of getting visitors past the wall and into the gallery in huge numbers . <p> Visitors really looked at and responded to the art . The completed sheets reveal incredible thoughtfulness , humor , and creative invention from visitors of all ages . We had very few " throw away " results . <p> The variety of creative responses we received reflect the myriad perspectives of visitors to our interdisciplinary institution . <p> We needed more display space for visitors ' finished sheets and space to group completed sheets to better facilitate rating and commenting by other visitors . Although visitors of all ages participated , a special " kids ' corner " on the display board would have communicated more easily that both adults and kids were welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful than others , and some people used the sheets in completely independent ways , ignoring the prompt entirely . A few did n't even incorporate the post-its ( not that this is a bad thing ) . The " On the Edge " activity , which encouraged visitors to extend the images on the post-its beyond the frame was by far the most popular prompt . Many attracted to this prompt even connected separate works into a single composition . Also , a couple of the prompts were too similar , as visitors generally used them in the same way . <p> Overwhelmingly visitors wanted a post-it reproduction of every work in the exhibition . <p> Going forward we need better technology solutions on-site to help visitors and staff share responses as they are happening . We collected , scanned , and posted completed sheets to the museum website and Facebook page , and knowing that the sheets would be posted online was a motivator especially for 20- to 30-year-olds . We needed a way for visitors to share their work immediately on their own social media sites . Smartphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size and the legibility of the artists ' writings and drawings . <p> It would be good to have a way to gather metrics or track how ( and if ) visitors are sharing their creations on their own social media channels . <p> Having the completed sheets attached to the specific artworks that motivated the visitors provides a clear context for the various interpretations and insights that will survive long after the exhibition is gone . <h> QUESTIONS <p> Overall we are happy with the results of this experiment , and we are busy thinking about some of the issues and opportunities related to this activity going forward , but we 'd also love to hear from you . If you have any feedback or suggestions , please comment here or send a note to **28;3326;TOOLONG <p> We 're curious about the sustainability of the post-its . How important is the novelty of the concept , or could we repeat this activity ? <p> Would it work without full-time staff support ? If we changed the public display part could we make this an activity visitors can understand on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member a crucial visitor engagement connection ? <h> Wednesday , October 31 , 2012 <p> Ever wish for a low-cost , energizing professional development experience where you can work intensely with diverse colleagues in a risk-tolerant environment ? <p> I 'm involved in four upcoming events that I 'd love for you to consider attending . Three of them are being hosted at my museum , and one at a mystery location . <p> You Ca n't Do That in Museums Camp - July 10-12 , 2013 . I 've always loved helping run events where participants can really work together on something meaty and challenging ... and this one is going to be awesome . In July of 2013 , the MAH will host our first You Ca n't Do That in Museums Camp ( or better name to be suggested by you ) , inviting 80 creative people to collaborate on an experimental exhibition . This camp will be a 2.5 day event at which participants work in teams with pre-selected permanent collection objects to create an exhibition full of intriguing , unusual , risky experiences . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed the boundaries , this is the event for you . Registration will be $150 and by application only . We will also offer a half-day series of workshops on July 10 for a wider audience for $50 . Yes you can sleepover at the museum to heighten the insanity and reduce the cost . No you do n't have to be a museum professional to participate . Yes you can apply now . Please do . <p> The Arts Dinner-vention Project - date TBD . This one was cooked up by Barry Hessenius , former director of the California Arts Council and public art blogger extraordinaire . Barry is asking the universe to send him names of " unheralded arts sector leaders " to be considered for an all-star dinner party in 2013 . I 'm on the small committee of folks who will be selecting the winners based on your nominations . Barry is accepting nominations through November 20 , and anyone who submits names will be entered into a random drawing for a free trip to join in on the fantasy dinner party . Read more about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weekend - Jan 12-13 , 2013 . We 're working with participatory online artist Ze Frank on an exhibition at the MAH this winter that features the missions , creations , and explorations of his current web series , A Show . Because this work is evolving and involves people creating stuff all over the world , we decided it would be good to have a weekend where that wildness can find a home at our museum . I know very little about what will happen on this weekend , but rest assured it will be strange and geeky and very different from a typical museum gathering . <p> Loyalty Lab workshop - Jan 29 , 2013 . We have been working for a few months now on a project called Loyalty Lab to deepen our relationships with frequent MAH visitors . On Jan. 29 , we 'll be holding a workshop in the afternoon to discuss our experiments to date and brainstorm with participants about how we can all find creative , low-tech ways to reward and celebrate our visitors . We would love to share that conversation with anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have some whip-smart game designers on hand to push our thinking . We can accommodate about 25 people at the workshop - please email me if you are interested in participating . <p> Here 's to a new year full of experimenting , learning , and sharing . And by " new year " I mean year six of Museum 2.0 . I know ; it 's crazy . <h> Wednesday , October 24 , 2012 <p> I like to ask myself this question periodically , challenging myself to find substantive ways for visitors to contribute to our museum . Yes , we have the standard ways--volunteer programs , board service , and community partnerships--but I strongly believe that if we are doing our jobs right , every visitor who walks through our doors should be able to make a meaningful impact . <p> To that end , our exhibitions are full of participatory elements . Visitors can comment on how we can improve or what they would like to see . They can contribute their own stories , objects , and creative work to exhibitions . We actively seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . <p> That 's all fabulous , but it 's also all by design . And when I think back on the past year , some of the most magical things that have happened at the museum have NOT been designed by us . Instead , they 've been driven by community members who see the museum as a platform for their own creative pursuits . <p> Here are just four surprises that have invigorated the museum in the past few weeks : <p> Pop Up Tea Ceremony . Last month , a couple came in and asked if they could stage a pop up tea ceremony at the museum . We said yes , and they have now participated in several events , offering a unique mix of traditional tea ceremony , koto music , and bedazzled plastic microphones ( see bottom left of photograph ) . <p> Happening Couch . A local engineer , Greg McPheeters , brought his tandem-bike powered recycled couch to our Trash to Treasure festival last Friday night . Riding the art couch through downtown Santa Cruz with two visitors and a dog while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my year . Here 's a picture of it in action . <p> Evergreen Cemetery Board Game . One of our research volunteers , Sangye Hawke , blew me away when she posted a photo on Facebook of the board game she 's developing about the restoration work we 're doing at historic Evergreen Cemetery . What started as a fun personal project for her will hopefully become part of our permanent history gallery--a space we are trying to make more interactive over the coming years . <p> Connections through Collections . A college student who visited our Santa Cruz Collects exhibition wrote to us after her visit to share that she has a childhood collection of bouncy balls ( like Aaron Schumacher , a young collector profiled in the exhibition ) . The student is now donating her collection to Aaron so his can keep growing . <p> Of course , for every one of these enchanting surprises , we also have many of more variable quality : people who walk in with their paintings on their back asking about display opportunities , people who send us poorly-produced videos of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd conversations . It 's not unusual for me and our public programming staff members to have several short interactions every week with newcomers who walk in the door with idiosyncratic visions for cultural engagement . <p> I 've realized that while I always used to ask that question in the frame of " what are we doing to make it possible for community members to make this institution better ? , " the most powerful evidence of it happening is when our active role as designers/facilitators becomes invisible . Community members , artists , and organizations increasingly see our museum as a place where they can advance their own goals , and so they approach us . We do n't have to convince them that it 's their museum . Instead , we just have to be generous and thoughtful about how they can--or cannot--participate with us . We 've even started reflexively mumbling , " well , it is your museum , " when someone comes dancing in the door or moves a chair or starts reciting poetry . <p> To me , this is an example of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organization has in its community . We 've created a very consistent message about being an open platform for local creativity--through exhibitions , event design , online , even the conversations we have with the press . And while we are still continually seeking out great partners and cultural combinations , we 're not always the instigators of those opportunities . The more we structure in participation , the more people feel empowered to bring their own brilliance to the table , spontaneously and completely beyond our expectations . The magic is n't by design . It happens because people see an opening where there was n't one before . <p> Venue as content platform instead of content provider : the museum becomes a stage on which professionals and amateurs can curate , interpret , and remix artifacts and information . <p> Architecture of participation with network effects : each person who participates contributes something meaningful and lasting . Visitors ' interactions allow them both to personalize their museum experiences and to engage with other visitors through their shared interests . The museum gets better the more people use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flux , incrementally releasing new versions , refining procedures , and responding to audience desires . <p> Flexible , modular support for distributed products : inviting people to plug-in their own creations , whether those be DIY audio tours , pop up events , or co-created exhibitions . <p> From 2006-2011 , I focused almost entirely on #1 and #2 , playing with ways to invite visitors to actively participate with professionals to co-create powerful experiences around museum objects . <p> But in the past year and a half as a museum director , I find myself increasingly interested in #3 and #4 . In a lot of ways , our successful turnaround at the MAH has been driven by both embracing incremental change and opening up clear opportunities for community organizations and individuals to " plug " their cultural brilliance into our space . We 're using #3 and #4 to achieve #1 and #2 in the Museum 2.0 playbook . <p> At first , our enthusiasm for incremental change and flexibility was a reaction to a tough financial position . When I started at the MAH last May , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision to be a thriving , central gathering place for our community . The only way to reconcile our resources with our goals was to start doing whatever we could to start nudging in the direction of our dreams . We scrounged for free couches . We invited local artists and community groups to perform . We designed events and interactive exhibits on ten dollar budgets . We experimented with everything--hours , front desk staffing structure , community programs . We knew we were n't doing everything at the desired quality level . But we got it going anyway . <p> A year and a half later , we are in a much more stable financial position ... and we 've tried to internalize a mindset of perpetual beta and modular support for community collaboration . As things got better financially , as we learned more about what worked and did n't , we replaced furniture and enhanced our exhibitions . We upped the budgets and the scale of the projects while maintaining an iterative approach that relies on prototyping and low-tech experiments . <p> I feel strongly that as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fulfill that mission , we should do everything we can every step of the way to attack it , even if that means starting with something simplistic , messy , or uncertain . We make room for interns and artists and people who walk in the door with crazy ideas . There are plenty of times I have silenced the exhibit designer in my brain who wanted everything just so , or the museum director who wanted to make our visitors happy all the time . If we 're going to move forward , we have to be able to try things in a risk-tolerant environment . <p> One of the things that often made me uncomfortable as a consultant was the extent to which museums , and their funding vehicles , often make perpetual beta an impossibility . The exhibit is planned for years and must open perfect on day 1 . The grant is for a three-year educational program whose curriculum has to be locked in from the start . If we ca n't have a perfect couch designed by Frank Gehry , we wo n't give visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum professionals and visitors alike . For museum professionals , it creates a falsely elevated sense of risk and stress around projects that , let 's face it , do n't have to be perfect out of the gate . No one is going to die if you change a label a few days after opening . No one will be seriously injured if you invite a dance company in and they do something strange . No one will suffer if you put out a prototype--or two , or ten--before finalizing a design . We need to build experimentation into our work processes if we want our work to evolve over time . <p> For museum visitors , the damage is even worse . How many brilliant sparks of ideas never get to the public because we falsely assume it will take too many resources to get them off the ground ? How can we show people that we truly care about making our institutions welcoming , or challenging , or fun , or creative , if we need two years and eight approvals to put out some couches and paintbrushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't strive for excellence . What I 've seen--in Web 2.0 and elsewhere--is that real excellence comes from incrementally pushing towards a big audacious goal . If you can get it right on the first try or with the resources you have , then your dreams may not be big enough . <p> What are you working towards , and how you are iterating and experimenting to get there ? <h> Wednesday , October 10 , 2012 <p> Let 's look at the statistics from three big participatory projects that wrapped up recently . Each of these invited members of the public to vote on art in a way that had substantive consequences--big cash prizes awarded , prestige granted , exhibitions offered . <p> ArtPrize , the grandaddy of visitor voting , just completed its fourth year in Grand Rapids , Michigan . This citywide festival showcased work by 1,517 artists competing for a $200,000 top cash prize awarded by public vote . An estimated 400,000 people attended the event over two weeks , of which 47,000 cast at least one vote . Voters had to register to vote , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could " like . " <p> The Brooklyn Museum just finished the public stage of GO , a " community-curated open studio project . " GO invited people to visit artists ' studios throughout Brooklyn over one weekend and to nominate up to three favorites ; the top ten will be considered for an upcoming group show at the museum . 1,708 artists participated . An estimated 18,000 people attended , of which 4,929 nominated artists for the show . Note that in this case , people had to register to vote AND check in at at least five studios to be eligible to nominate artists for the show . Full stats here . <p> The Hammer Museum recently awarded the first annual Mohn Award , a $100,000 prize that will be awarded biannually to an artist in the " Made in LA " biennial exhibition based on public vote . Five artists out of sixty in the show were short-listed by a jury . 50,000 people visited the exhibition , and 2,051 voted for their favorite artist of the five . Fascinating ( and long ) article about the Mohn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press and public dialogue mostly revolved around the idea of public voting for art . But when it came to the actual experience , the vast majority of participants and attendees did NOT vote . In Grand Rapids , 12% cast a ballot . In Brooklyn , 27% made it through the voting process . In LA , only 4% voted . <p> What 's going on here ? Why are hundreds of thousands of people flocking to Grand Rapids for ArtPrize but not choosing to vote ? Why did the Hammer Museum have record summer attendance if people were n't coming for the thing that was being flaunted--the opportunity to vote ? <p> There are surely some people who did n't want to go through the hassle of registering and learning the rules of voting . There are others who may not have felt " qualified " to select winners and losers . But my sense is that the biggest reason people did n't vote is that for most visitors , voting was n't the point . The point was to be part of an exciting , dynamic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , that 's what I experienced when I went to ArtPrize in 2010 . I was blown away by the social experience provoked by the unorthodox format . Voting on individual artworks turned each one into a social object worthy of lengthy conversation . Talking with Shelley Bernstein at the Brooklyn Museum , it sounds like GO comparably sparked a huge number of community conversations in artists ' studios around Brooklyn . When the public is invited to decide , they may not take on that power and responsibility ... but they may show up in droves to see what the fuss is about . <p> This leads me to two conflicting perspectives on voting in exhibitions : <p> Voting on substantive outcomes ( money , exhibitions ) is good because it provokes engagement with objects , artists , and fellow visitors . Whether you tick the ballot or not , the opportunity to do so opens up a conversation about what 's good , what 's bad , and what 's art . <p> Voting on substantive outcomes is dangerous because not enough people participate to make serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public vote component of the Mohn Award after only 2,051 people determined who would win $100,000 . And in Brooklyn , Shelley Bernstein noted that the data generated during GO was insufficient to generate statistical significance in a " wisdom of the crowds decision-making " format . In the case of ArtPrize , founder Rick DeVos has explicitly said that the event is a creative act designed to engage people in " conversation " about art . And yet they have added juried prizes alongside the public ones to diversify that conversation . <p> How do you weigh the positive engagement that comes with community dialogue against the ethics of voting for outcomes that matter deeply to the artists involved ? <h> Wednesday , October 03 , 2012 <p> Last week , I became completely intoxicated with the online videos of Vi Hart , self-described mathemusician . Her nerdy , entertaining videos about math evoke the power of free choice learning while poking gentle fun at the drudgery of how math is often taught in school . She 's brilliant and funny and pushes people to get excited about higher math @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best science center educator ever . <p> But Vi does n't work in a science museum . She was a free agent for a long time , until the beginning of 2012 , when she joined the teaching staff of Khan Academy . <p> Khan Academy , the free , nonprofit online source for educational instructional videos , is a young powerhouse in the online learning space . Its multilingual videos have reached almost 200 million viewers since it launched in 2006 . Its funding has skyrocketed as major foundations and technology companies have made multi-million dollar grants and investments in its growth . Founder Salman Khan started by sharing his own videos with a math and science focus , and in the last year , he has added new " faculty " including Vi Hart as well as Drs . Beth Harris and Steven Zucker , who are well known in museums for their excellent Smarthistory website and podcasts . <p> Khan Academy is interesting in itself as an online learning space . But the participation of partners like Vi , Beth , and Steven puts it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people access to good instructional content on standard ( and often confusing or poorly taught ) educational topics . How to solve a quadratic equation . How to titrate an acid . Test prep for the SAT . This is all fine , but it exists very much in the K12 and college framework . <p> Vi Hart 's videos , on the other hand , are idiosyncratic , explorative , and a bit subversive . Beth Harris and Steven Zucker 's content about art history is social and dialogue-based in format . These instructors are n't teaching you the equivalent of a high school course in math or art history . They are connecting you with knowledge and inspiration in more creative ways ... the way the best museums do . It 's no coincidence that Beth Harris ' last job was as Director of Digital Learning at MoMA . <p> Does this mean Khan Academy is competitive with museums ? Maybe . More importantly , it means that we should be looking to their model to push ourselves in how we think about delivering the most engaging , powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in providing substantive , essential alternatives to formal schooling . But museums are rarely seen as pursuing this promise in the innovative , aggressive , and highly publicized way that Khan Academy is . <p> I asked Beth Harris and Steven Zucker about their experience working at Khan Academy after years in academia and museums . When I asked them what 's in it for Smarthistory to be a part of Khan Academy , they highlighted the extent to which Khan Academy represents a revolution in education and high quality online learning experiences . Here are some of the comments on the " why " behind their involvement : <p> Khan Academy has a hugely generous vision and commitment to rethinking education -- our mission is " a world-class education , for anyone , anywhere " -- not to mention brilliant programmers and staff . This is an epic moment in the history of education , who would n't want to be part of it ? We are finally leaving behind the 18th century model of education where groups of students are expected to learn at a standard pace . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accreditation are being unbundled . New institutions and new , more personal modes of teaching and learning are being investigated . And we will soon know much more about learning , thanks to analytics , than we ever have before . <p> Khan Academy is much more than a huge library of high quality videos , there are learning analytics , self-paced exercises , and perhaps most importantly , a committed learning community -- even for art history ! We have a great community of learners that ask and answer questions and our videos are being translated by volunteers all over the world . We are reminded of how much fun learning can be . <p> They advocated for the power of online research and learning : <p> There is a huge appetite for knowledge about art that is not being met . We both come from higher education and it 's always seemed remarkable to us how little museums work together to support the study of art . Students around the world want to understand the history of art , not necessarily the history of a particular collection . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just for research , but for learning . Learning is increasingly global and fluid and the fact that cross-institutional initiatives such as the Google Art Project and Europeana are rare , points to how much work still needs to be done . We wrote about that in a recent blog post , Why the Google Art Project is Important . <p> Many museums produce superb lesson plans , curator interviews and artist interviews for the web . But there are other content models we can explore . Conversation has been key to Smarthistory 's success , and we 've worked with several museums to facilitate the creation of conversation-based content . We 've also done short technology workshops to enable content experts to create their own videos . In the era of YouTube , we do n't always need Final Cut Pro and expensive videographers . <p> And they talked about the difference between working for a museum and working for a startup nonprofit : <p> We both loved working for MoMA in different capacities . But as everyone knows , museums are not the easiest ships to turn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real asset ; working for a start-up has allowed us to produce a lot of high-quality academic content . For the Google Art Project , the two of us recorded , edited and produced 90 videos in four months ( with only a small amount of editing assistance ) . Obviously , museums produce fantastic content , but we wonder if their limited resources should remain focused on traditional print publishing . The principles of digital publishing -- which is iterative , personal , prolific , and collaborative , could unleash museums as active centers of learning and engagement . <p> One of the things that baffles us about museums is that while they support scholars with deep expertise , they produce relatively little content for public consumption on the web . The focus remains on the high status , expensive and little-read exhibition catalogue , instead of developing web-based content that will draw more visitors , and help create a loyal web-community . An educator at the Met recently told us of a group of visitors from Japan that joined a gallery tour and promptly asked to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want museums to be pioneers in free choice learning , seen and funded as " hugely generous " and committed visionaries who are rethinking education , we need to push ourselves . Beth and Steven ended their email to me by quoting Salman Khan 's new book , The One World Schoolhouse : Education Reimagined , in which he writes : <p> What 's needed , in my view , is a perspective that allows us a fresh look at our most basic assumptions about teaching and learning , a perspective that takes nothing for granted and focuses on the simple but crucial questions of what works , what does n't work , and why . <p> What would that " fresh look " mean for museums ? <p> Thank you to Beth and Steven for contributing to this post . They wanted me to tell you that Smarthistory invites art historians and curators to contribute in the their areas of expertise . If you would like to contribute , please contact them at : Steven@khanacademy.org and Beth@khanacademy.org <h> Wednesday , September 26 , 2012 <p> Stacey Marie Garcia came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2011 . Since then , Stacey has become an indispensable member of our staff , leading our community programs and inspiring us to think in new ways about how we can build social capital in our community . I learn a ton from her every day and wanted to share her thinking--and her graduate thesis--with you . <p> There were times when coordinating a fire art festival while researching social capital theory made me want to burn my computer . But , overall I felt overwhelmingly fortunate to be in a job , a museum and a community that I loved and furthermore to be afforded the valuable time most of us do not have to devote to further researching , thinking about , reading and discussing the theories that comprise the foundation of my work . <p> I chose to focus my thesis on Community and Civic Engagement in Museum Programs . The purpose of my thesis was two-fold : <p> To research and analyze community and civic engagement practices , methods , theories and examples in other museum programs . <p> To apply the results of my analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Santa Cruz Museum of Art &; History ( the MAH ) . <p> You can download and read the full version of my thesis here . For the purpose of this blog post I 'll discuss three key ingredients from my thesis that can activate community engagement in museum programs and how we apply this to programs at the MAH : assessing and responding to community assets and needs , building social capital , and inviting active participation . <h> Assess and Respond to Community Assets and Needs <p> If you want to activate community engagement in your programs , you first need to work together with your communities to determine their diverse needs , assets and interests . This can be accomplished through a variety of feedback methods conducted both inside and outside the museum . Deeper community relationships through focus groups or community advising committees can further help museums connect with issues relevant to their communities while also hold the museum accountable for their responses . <p> Two exceptional examples of community committees stand out : one long standing , The Community Advisory Committees of The Wing Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Creative Community Council of the Children 's Creativity Museum . Both emphasize museums reaching out into the community to support , understand and experience what the community is already doing . They stress community engagement should be an asset- over needs-based approach . It 's not solely about how museums can serve communities but rather what are the communities ' resources , knowledge and interests that can inform museum practice ? Furthermore , how can museums and communities work together to share strengths in the community ? <p> Museum programs need to then actively respond to their communities through a variety of ongoing discursive , collaborative and inclusive formats that address needs and assets but also invite communities to be active participants in this process . <h> At the MAH <p> Our first program goal is to meet the needs and assets of our community as defined by our community . We seek to understand this by listening to and developing ongoing dialogues with a range of community members . We attentively respond to requests and purposefully use different modes of feedback to inform program design from our comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside and outside the museum , creative feedback at events such as our Show and Tell Booth and online visitor surveys specific to our programs . We continuously and actively respond to requests as well as invite people to be a part of our programs . <p> We also formed a Creative Community Committee ( C3 ) , composed of a diverse range of multigenerational community representatives from social services , the arts , business , education , the city , technology and our board of directors to provide a multitude of perspectives and expertise . C3 meets bimonthly to help us understand and brainstorm ways the MAH can collaboratively implement and address the needs and assets of the vast array of communities in Santa Cruz County . <h> Build Social Capital <p> A crucial theory in community engagement through museum programs is social capital theory , best defined by Robert D. Putnam , who has written extensively about social capital in American society in his book , Bowling Alone . Putnam defines social capital as " connections among individuals-social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should gradually and increasingly encompass both distinct forms of bonding and bridging to create healthier , wiser , more connected , economically and socially sustainable communities . <p> Bonding social capital refers to networks that bring people together with common interests to strengthen relationships in preexisting groups . <p> Bridging refers to an inclusive and outward looking form of linking different and diverse individuals and groups together to form new relationships . <p> Museum programs can be designed to further bond similar groups together such as families and friends in family workshops such as the Dallas Museum of Art 's First Tuesdays . Museum programs can also bridge different groups that might not typically interact such as the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum 's Educational Residential Centre , which designed a program specifically to bridge children of two groups engaged in social conflict , Catholics and Protestants . <p> Co-created programming that represents the complex range of voices in communities , offers platforms for communication , collaboration and shared experiences that can enrich preexisting relationships while also offer a space for new relationships to form and strengthen . An example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faculty and students in Portland State University 's Art and Social Practice Department for their annual Shine a Light program . The program is an experimental playground that bridges artists , students , chefs , comedians , hairdressers , bartenders , dancers , wrestlers and even tattoo artists to produce a community-led event . Collaborative programs with diverse groups bring in a variety of visitors causing new audiences to interact and connect . <h> At the MAH <p> Our second community program goal is to build social capital by strengthening community connections with our collaborators and visitors . This is a continual process of bonding within preexisting groups and bridging between groups and individuals who might not usually interact . <p> Our programs bond our collaborators by closely co-creating programs with community organizations which strengthens their individual internal connections and their relationship to the MAH . For example , the MAH 's Poetry and Book Arts Extravaganza event partnered with Book Arts Santa Cruz and Poetry Santa Cruz to collaborate with 61 talented book artists and poets . Evaluation surveys showed that Book Arts Santa Cruz members felt their bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity that increased group dialogue and stimulated a sense of pride , identity and vision around their work as a group at this event . <p> Cardboard tube orchestra at Radical Craft Night . <p> MAH programs are also designed to bond and bridge visitors through creative activities that form participatory dialogical spaces where knowledge is enhanced , widened and deepened through meaningful opportunities for visitors to converse , discuss and collaborate with each other . Relationships can grow as families bond over a Family Art Day experience or friends can work together to create their own shoebox guitar at Santa Cruz Music 3 rd Friday or strangers can collaborate by participating in a cardboard tube orchestra . <p> Sometimes we purposefully bridge distinct groups as well such as middle-aged women from local knitting groups with young college students interested in street art to yarn bomb our stairwell for Radical Craft Night . The MAH 's historic Evergreen Cemetery brings together the Homeless Services Center and MAH volunteers or the local rugby team to collaboratively restore the cemetery . We are constantly looking for new meaningful opportunities to bridge groups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Participation <p> Participatory design can be one of the most effective vehicles for developing relationships , building social capital and engaging with community members in museum programs . Implementing participatory activities and constructivist learning theories allow the learner to actively experiment cognitively and physically , individually and socially , and to collectively build meaning and knowledge . Participatory programming highlights alternative narratives , activates communities and reverses the role of the visitors from consumer to producer , which in turn engenders more connected and active communities . <p> The value of participatory experiences is epitomized in FIGMENT , a free , creative , participatory , non-profit , community art event . This participatory event led by emerging artists from all backgrounds , engages communities by encouraging a culture of making , doing , creating and collaboration rather than spectatorship . <p> The Denver Art Museum has been leading the way with dynamic programs such as Untitled , which offers a variety of non-traditional encounters with art and the museum through participatory , multidisciplinary activities led by Denver 's creative community . <h> At the MAH <p> Our third community program goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for visitors to have meaningful , hands-on , cultural experiences in which they act as contributors and co-creators , not just consumers . We scaffold levels of participatory experiences at events that are intergenerational , multidisciplinary and appeal to different types of learners . We give visitors a new skill to claim rather than a product and work intensely with our collaborators to insure active participation in their activities . <p> All of our events require some level of participation . Sometimes that results in an artist-led cascading collaborative sculpture of 475 visitor-made scrap metal fish . Other times it 's a collaborative collage animation workshop , a black light art activity with red lentils , dodge ball , recording songs to send to loved ones , writing haikus for strangers or an urban history scavenger hunt on bikes . <p> Artists from different worlds , brought together through Street Art Night . <p> Our events invite our collaborators to work with us to design participatory activities and offer visitors active , collaborative and meaningful experiences that inspire citizens to positively and actively contribute to their communities . <h> Final Thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful community engagement in museum programs but they are central for MAH programs and for our community . This summer , at our Street Art Night , when I saw a young graffiti artist learning how to knit from a woman in her sixties and then taught her how to spray paint or at Experience Metal , when a motorcycle repairman learns how to operate a new tool from an art bike welder or when families work together to create their own cardboard neighborhood or when two individuals who met at one of our events team up to collaborate- it allows me to see first hand the gradual impact of our goals on the community and makes me realize all those late nights spent writing my thesis were completely worth it . <p> Stacey will be responding to your questions and comments on this post . Enjoy her thesis , share your own example , have a meaty conversation . <h> Wednesday , September 19 , 2012 <p> Note : This is a post about gender diversity . I feel strongly that there are huge issues with racial and ethnic diversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts . I do n't know if gender diversity deserves more posts . That 's why I wrote this . <p> Last week , I spoke at three conferences . One was a conference on risk-taking for librarians . One was a conference on pushing our practice in art museums . And one was a local TEDx . The first two had something in common that the last one did n't . Any guesses ? <p> In library- and museum-land , the participants were 80-90% women . At TEDx , the mix was 50/50 . <p> It took me awhile to catch on to the gender divide in museums , arts organizations , and libraries . I was an electrical engineering student ( 1% women ) , then worked at NASA ( 10% women ) , and then slowly slid from science museums ( about 50% women ) to history and art museums ( 60-80% , depending on who you ask ) . Even the museums I worked in with a fairly equivalent gender balance were completely out-of-whack when you looked at departments . Exhibits , technology , security , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female central . <p> At first , I reveled in working in progressively more female-engaged environments after my engineering background . But running a museum with 100% female full-time staff and 95% female interns has made me struggle with the obvious disparity . When we have new jobs or internships open up , men represent less than 5% of applicants . We have good male representation as volunteers , trustees , and visitors , but we 're lousy on staff . We have 0.75 full-time equivalent men between a contract preparator , graphic designer , and visitor services staff member . We ca n't even rate a whole guy . <p> Judging from statistics in a few research studies on museum workers ( and the obvious visual data at any museum or library conference excepting tech-oriented ones ) , this imbalance is extreme but not atypical . It gets even worse if you look at the future of the field . AAM has noted that museum studies graduate programs are " 80% white and 80% female . " It 's not quite as bad as my 99% male electrical engineering class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem . Without this most basic kind of diversity on staff , people make myopic decisions that are biased towards certain audience types . Just as a male-dominated tech industry created a hugely celebrated device that women thought sounded like a menstrual management product ( the iPad ) , a female-dominated museum and library industry leads to a narrow set of preconceptions when it comes to program development and design . I 've had plenty of meetings where we had to remind ourselves that we could n't just create craft activities for women and no there would not be hearts on the walls in the Love exhibition . We consult community advisors on a regular basis to compensate for our gender diversity ( and other ) deficiencies and ensure that our programming is meaningful and non-exclusionary for men . It 's a challenge on a daily basis to run an organization for our whole community when our staff represents half at most . <p> But , and here 's where it gets tricky ... how BIG a problem is this gender imbalance ? When we talk about other kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that the problem is serious . Many museums and other arts organizations are seen as instruments of an elitist , white culture that systematically excludes people of color ( e.g. this post ) . True diversity on staff leads to the exposure and deconstruction of discriminatory practices that prevent our organizations from feeling truly relevant and open to diverse community members . <p> It 's not as clear to me that this same issue applies when talking about men , especially white men , who are not victims of systematic discrimination . When it comes to fields like engineering , the reason that people are so energized about increasing minority participation is twofold : <p> Many minorities ( women and racial/ethnic minorities ) receive constant harmful messages about their inadequacy when it comes to that may prevent them from pursuing passions in math and science . This is perceived by some as deeply unfair . It takes active intervention and investment to reverse this systematic discrimination and bias . <p> Engineering careers come with economic opportunity that can move people up socio-economically and advance national GDP/innovation . Engineering jobs can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some inequity and cultivating more overall wealth . <p> Do these same arguments apply in fields like the non-profit arts ? These jobs are low-paying , economically unstable , and highly competitive . They are not seen ( unfortunately ) as essential to generating significant personal or community wealth and value . And I do n't know that there is a systematic gender bias preventing men from pursuing careers in arts or education . I 've never heard of a man who was told that art might be too " hard " for him as my female college roommate was told about mechanical engineering . There may be a gender representation issue in museums , but is there an equity issue ? I 'm not sure . <p> I would really , really like to work with more men . I would love for them to be interested and to be represented . But I do n't know where the point is at which men are feeling deterred from their interests in pursuing museum careers and what I can do about it . I do n't know if I should worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fields that are gender-imbalanced as long as minority voices have a role in program development and production . Maybe it 's great that there 's a field where women can take the lead . I 'm proud that our institution went from having a male director and all-female staff to a female director and all-female staff--at least girlpower goes all the way to the top here . There are plenty of other content and media industries that do n't have female domination--our power in museums could be a balancing salve in the bigger picture . We can and do create superb programming for our whole community , with the same implicit deficiencies of any organization that lacks diversity . <p> Or maybe it 's terrible that men are slowly opting out of museum work . Maybe it means they will slowly opt out of cultural institutions altogether and perceive them as irrelevant to their lives . I know from talking to friends who work in ballet that it is indeed possible for a whole genre of art to be seen as " for women . " <p> What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , visitors , or society ? How does it affect you ? What should we do about it ? <h> Wednesday , September 12 , 2012 <p> In the spirit of a popular post written earlier this year , I want to share the behind the scenes on our current almost-museumwide exhibition at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art &; History , Santa Cruz Collects . This exhibition showcases collectors from throughout Santa Cruz County--people with collections from animal skulls to dryer lint to priceless historic flags . The content focuses on the question of WHY we collect and how our collections reflect our individual and community identities . <p> This exhibition represents a few big shifts for us : <p> We used a more participatory design process . Our previous big exhibition , All You Need is Love , was highly participatory for visitors but minimally participatory in the development process . Santa Cruz Collects is based on collections and stories from people throughout our county . That meant months of tracking down leads for people with interesting collections and working with them to develop an approach to showcasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their experiences . <p> We had some money . Instead of a total budget of $200 for participatory elements , we spent about $4,000 on materials for participatory elements in this exhibition . This shift was largely thanks to a grant from the James Irvine Foundation , which provided funding for a key component--the Memory Jar installation . A million thanks to them . <p> We focused more on design . While the Love exhibition was popular , it was our first attempt at full integration of interdisciplinary content on a big human idea , interactivity , and participation . The result was not as visually cohesive or attractive as it could have been . Coming off that experience , we wanted to prove that we could have great design AND great participation in this show . We worked with an incredible intern and staff team to push it to the next level , both by improving the overall visual aesthetic of the show and by focusing in on fewer , more developed interactive components . Santa Cruz Collects has garnered rave reviews visually from some of the same people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're involving visitor services and volunteers more intentionally in facilitation . This is the first time we 've had an ongoing activity with a lot of materials ( Memory Jars ) . There are Legos and fake flowers and fabric scraps and sand and a whole lot more . Rather than having our exhibit team walk through and fix things up every once in awhile , we wrote facilitation plans for the Memory Jars and other intensive participatory elements . Our visitor services team is responsible for managing , replacing , documenting , and in some cases , improving these elements now that they are live on the floor . <p> Without further ado , here 's what we did to make the exhibition participatory . You can find several more photographs here . I hope there 's something in here you can use . As always , I welcome your questions and comments . <p> Process : <p> A sample exhibition label for one of the collections - incredible toasters from 1906 to 1960 . <p> We collaborated with community members to source content and develop the show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We did a series of call-outs to find intriguing collectors . Sometimes , we 'd hear something vague about a guy with great branding irons or a lady who showed wild stuff at the county fair . We tracked down as many people as we could and developed a big spreadsheet so we could evaluate the possibilities . We wanted diversity along several axes--stories , types and sizes and scales of collections , perception of value , age of collector , gender , and geographic home base of collector . We were fortunate to have an in-house team with varied attention ; while I cared most about the stories behind the collecting , our art curator Susan fixated on aesthetics of the objects , and our history curator Marla focused on novelty , diversity of county representation , and whether people were calling us back . Because we wanted a really clean design and a personal feel , we interviewed all the collectors to capture their stories , creating labels that blended their first-person quotes with our curatorial commentary about the " why " behind their collecting . A stellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each collector in his/her element . While some collectors had us select and design the displays of their objects , others collaborated with us to create their areas , adding their own unique quirks ( like putting hats on computers to personalize them ) . <p> We worked with volunteers and interns again to create soundscapes that focused on collecting . One volunteer captured stories at the flea market ; another asked people on the street about the memories they would keep ( to accompany the Memory Jars ) . <p> We worked co-creatively with a group of anthropologists and archaeologists from UCSC to produce a small exhibition on the 3rd floor based on a pre-existing exhibition they had created about how they encounter and work with objects in their global research . We agreed to take the artifacts from their original show but worked with them to rewrite labels and shift the focus to be more personal and in-line with the Santa Cruz Collects big idea . This was a partnership that involved meaty dialogue to get to a shared success ; it was important to the anthropologists that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or antiquity hunters , and it was important to us to show the human side of why they work with particular objects . <p> We made a giant mobile for the center of the museum out of origami birds folded from visitor comments received in the past year . Our community programs staff worked with visitors to make the birds , vote on a final design , and hang the mobile over a series of evening events prior to opening . <p> As in the past , we prototyped all interactive and participatory visitor experiences at museum events in the months leading up to the show . The prototypes were all simple , cheap , and extraordinarily valuable in shaping the final product . We have a rule that every prototype must be used to answer a specific question we can act on , whether that 's an A/B comparison , figuring out what 's confusing , etc . <h> First Floor <p> Exploring and making jars with the instructional mural in the background . <p> Memory Jars installation . Our first floor Lezin Gallery is small--about 300 square feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exhibition , to front load the concept that you the visitor are invited to actively contribute to the exhibition at hand . This time , instead of offering lots of little experiences , we devoted the gallery to one experience : making Memory Jars . The idea is simple : floor to ceiling shelving holding mason jars , each of which holds a label that reads " I remember ... " We put out donated craft materials and colored pencils and invite visitors to bottle up a memory to add to the collection . This activity was developed after several prototypes intended to explore the idea that some of our most precious collections are not physical at all . We tried collecting dreams , collecting smells or sounds or stories , but memories was most resonant . We decided ( with the support of the James Irvine Foundation ) to go big and devote the whole gallery to the activity , spending money to build shelves and buy matching jars . Since the activity is so simple to explain , we hired a local illustrator to create a giant mural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect people 's email addresses ( opt in ) on a clipboard if they want to come get their jar at the end of the show in late November . We 've been overwhelmed by participation in the first month . We have 400 jars , of which about 300 are filled already . Some are funny , some are sweet , some are poignant , some are sad . We 're going to need more jars . They might not match . <p> Pocket Museums in bathrooms . We also brought back the pocket museums in the first floor bathrooms - see last week 's post for more discussion of these and their mixed success . <h> Second Floor <p> A visitor mid-vote at the Deaccessioning station : are these objects worthy of our museum ? <p> The Solari Gallery is the heart of the exhibition , where the majority of the collections are on display . There are three participatory elements in this gallery : <p> What Kind of Collector Are You ? quiz . This is a teen magazine-style flowchart quiz that takes you through a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are ( based on five major types as defined by psychologists ) . Participants vote by putting a button in the jar labeled with the type they turn out to be . We 've found personality quizzes to be a very popular form of participation ; in this case , the layout allows you to either do the quiz and then vote on your type or to vote directly just by reading the labels on the jars . This might be a defect or a good thing . I talked to one visitor who told me , " I knew I was a ' for others ' type and then I went back and did the quiz to be sure . " <p> Deaccessioning interactive . We stole this idea directly from the 2009 UCL Disposal ? exhibition . We picked four objects from our collection with dubious connection to our collecting policy , explained the pros and cons of keeping each in short bullet-style labels , and let people vote on whether we should keep them or not . We were careful to phrase it as " pro/con " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promise to act based on visitors ' votes . After much debate about how to make this feel different from the personality quiz ( which also has a voting-style interaction ) , we decided to use tickers for votes--the same kind you use for counting people at events . People like clicking them , but they also monkey with the reset knobs on the side . Fortunately , anyone who changes the votes changes the pros and cons equally ( the reset button only affects the thousands digit ) . But the voter fraud is worth it . The activity does get people looking really deeply at the objects and arguing with their friends about what we should keep , and we can see their preferences in the votes . <p> Hoarders Anonymous . We did n't want to label any of the collectors in the exhibition as a hoarder , but we knew we wanted to deal with this topic . We created a simple table ( made from a cracked vitrine filled with junk ) with a hanging " Hoarders Anonymous " sign , an " Are You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help you keep from excessive hoarding , and a notebook where people can share their hoarding stories . And pencils . The only problem with this element is that the completed quizzes tend to pile up . They are n't fascinating or personal enough to take home , so they hang around . We thought about a different format for them or a way for people to add them to a " hoarded " pile , but we ultimately decided just to sweep through each day and recycle completed ones . While this table is in the middle of the gallery , people have very intense personal experiences writing in the notebook or doing the quizzes with friends . I credit the intern who developed this for a carefully honed sensitivity to both the seriousness and humor inherent in hoarding . <p> Digital Collections comment wall . One of the special collections in the show is from Bruce Damer 's Digibarn--an idiosyncratic personal museum of computer history . We wanted to create a talkback wall that dealt in some way with the fact that computers have become the repositories for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap digital storage has made hoarders of us all . But most of the prompts we came up with--how do you curate your digital files ? what are your most important digital collections ? --generated boring responses . After internal prototyping , we came up with a prompt about the opposite of digital collecting--digital loss . The current prompt reads , " I deleted those files because ... " and the setup is designed to resemble an old-school computer terminal . It has generated wonderful and diverse stories . <h> 3rd Floor Landing <p> Danny 's artifacts in the middle , flanked by visitor-generated lists . <p> List Scrolls . One of our collectors , Danny Lazzarini , collects found lists . We decided to use her collection as the basis for a participatory project in which visitors would contribute to large lists we put on scrolls flanking Danny 's . Again , it took a lot of prototyping to come up with prompts that were suitable evocative to generate interesting responses . Our final four are " Things that scare me , " " Things we forget , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The best feelings in the world . " We have markers out for people to respond , and the lists fill up with diverse responses . We cycle in one fresh list every two weeks so there are always lists that are full to read and others that invite new participants . After big events , they can get packed , but that 's kind of interesting too . There has been some sexual innuendo but nothing we deemed offensive so far . <p> Finally , it would feel completely strange to not give shout-outs to the staff and interns who made all of this possible . You may not care about the names of the individuals on our team , but they all deserve a million years of credit and goodwill . And the interns deserve rocking jobs . So thank you to interns Anna Greco , who led the Memory Jar and Deaccessioning development , Nora Grant , who created our Hoarding Anonymous chapter and helped with label writing , Rose Cannon , who developed the personality quiz and a little matching game ( not described in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made our labels absolutely gorgeous , and Megan Merritt , who made the perfect list scrolls . And of course , our killer exhibitions team , Susan Leask , Marla Novo , and most of all Robbie Schoen , who went above and beyond as preparator to make the most beautiful displays of electric drills and animal skulls that you will ever see . Many other people helped make this project happen , but this is the core team and I am incredibly honored to work with them . <p> And P.S. some of the interns are graduating and moving and we need more fabulous 
##42252 <h> Apocalypse Not : Here 's Why You Should n't Worry About End Times <p> This is the question posed by the website 2012apocalypse.net. " super volcanos ? pestilence and disease ? asteroids ? comets ? antichrist ? global warming ? nuclear war ? " the site 's authors are impressively open-minded about the cause of the catastrophe that is coming at 11:11 pm on december 21 this year . but they have no doubt it will happen . after all , not only does the Mayan Long Count calendar end that day , but " the sun will be aligned with the center of the Milky Way for the first time in about 26,000 years . " Case closed : Sell your possessions and live for today . <p> When the sun rises on December 22 , as it surely will , do not expect apologies or even a rethink . No matter how often apocalyptic predictions fail to come true , another one soon arrives . And the prophets of apocalypse always draw a following -- from the 100,000 Millerites who took to the hills in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thousands who believed in Harold Camping , the Christian radio broadcaster who forecast the final rapture in both 1994 and 2011 . <p> Religious zealots hardly have a monopoly on apocalyptic thinking . Consider some of the environmental cataclysms that so many experts promised were inevitable . Best-selling economist Robert Heilbroner in 1974 : " The outlook for man , I believe , is painful , difficult , perhaps desperate , and the hope that can be held out for his future prospects seem to be very slim indeed . " Or best-selling ecologist Paul Ehrlich in 1968 : " The battle to feed all of humanity is over . In the 1970s " and 1980s " was added in a later edition the world will undergo famines -- hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked on now ... nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate . " Or Jimmy Carter in a televised speech in 1977 : " We could use up all of the proven reserves of oil in the entire world by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of global famine and the end of oil in the 1970s proved just as wrong as end-of-the-world forecasts from millennialist priests . Yet there is no sign that experts are becoming more cautious about apocalyptic promises . If anything , the rhetoric has ramped up in recent years . Echoing the Mayan calendar folk , the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved its Doomsday Clock one minute closer to midnight at the start of 2012 , commenting : " The global community may be near a point of no return in efforts to prevent catastrophe from changes in Earth 's atmosphere . " <p> Over the five decades since the success of Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring in 1962 and the four decades since the success of the Club of Rome 's The Limits to Growth in 1972 , prophecies of doom on a colossal scale have become routine . Indeed , we seem to crave ever-more-frightening predictions -- we are now , in writer Gary Alexander 's word , apocaholic . The past half century has brought us warnings of population explosions , global famines , plagues , water wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinning ozone , acidifying rain , nuclear winters , Y2K bugs , mad cow epidemics , killer bees , sex-change fish , cell-phone-induced brain-cancer epidemics , and climate catastrophes . <p> So far all of these specters have turned out to be exaggerated . True , we have encountered obstacles , public-health emergencies , and even mass tragedies . But the promised Armageddons -- the thresholds that can not be uncrossed , the tipping points that can not be untipped , the existential threats to Life as We Know It -- have consistently failed to materialize . To see the full depth of our apocaholism , and to understand why we keep getting it so wrong , we need to consult the past 50 years of history . <p> The classic apocalypse has four horsemen , and our modern version follows that pattern , with the four riders being chemicals ( DDT , CFCs , acid rain ) , diseases ( bird flu , swine flu , SARS , AIDS , Ebola , mad cow disease ) , people ( population , famine ) , and resources ( oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Photo : Michael Ochs Archives/Getty <p> Silent Spring , published 50 years ago this year , was instrumental in the emergence of modern environmentalism . " Without this book , the environmental movement might have been long delayed or never have developed at all , " Al Gore wrote in his introduction to the 1994 edition . Carson 's main theme was that the use of synthetic pesticides -- DDT in particular -- was causing not only a massacre of wildlife but an epidemic of cancer in human beings . One of her chief inspirations and sources for the book was Wilhelm Hueper , the first director of the environmental arm of the National Cancer Institute . So obsessed was Hueper with his notion that pesticides and other synthetic chemicals were causing cancers ( and that industry was covering this up ) that he strenuously opposed the suggestion that tobacco-smoking take any blame . Hueper wrote in a 1955 paper called " Lung Cancers and Their Causes , " published in CA : A Cancer Journal for Clinicians , " Industrial or industry-related atmospheric pollutants are to a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking is not a major factor in the causation of lung cancer . " <p> In fact , of course , the link between smoking and lung cancer was found to be ironclad . But the link between modern chemicals and cancer is sketchy at best . Even DDT , which clearly does pose health risks to those unsafely exposed , has never been definitively linked to cancer . In general , cancer incidence and death rates , when corrected for the average age of the population , have been falling now for 20 years . <p> By the 1970s the focus of chemical concern had shifted to air pollution . Life magazine set the scene in January 1970 : " Scientists have solid experimental and theoretical evidence to support ... the following predictions : In a decade , urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution ... by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half . " Instead , driven partly by regulation and partly by innovation , both of which dramatically cut the pollution coming from car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cities in the developed world over the following few decades . Levels of carbon monoxide , sulphur dioxide , nitrogen oxides , lead , ozone , and volatile organic compounds fell and continue to fall . <p> In the 1980s it was acid rain 's turn to be the source of apocalyptic forecasts . In this case it was nature in the form of forests and lakes that would bear the brunt of human pollution . The issue caught fire in Germany , where a cover story in the news magazine Der Spiegel in November 1981 screamed : " the forest dies . " Not to be outdone , Stern magazine declared that a third of Germany 's forests were already dead or dying . Bernhard Ulrich , a soil scientist at the University of Gttingen , said it was already too late for the country 's forests : " They can not be saved . " Forest death , or waldsterben , became a huge story across Europe . " The forests and lakes are dying . Already the damage may be irreversible , " journalist Fred Pearce wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same in North America : Half of all US lakes were said to be becoming dangerously acidified , and forests from Virginia to central Canada were thought to be suffering mass die-offs of trees . <p> Conventional wisdom has it that this fate was averted by prompt legislative action to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions from power plants . That account is largely false . There was no net loss of forest in the 1980s to reverse . In the US , a 10-year government-sponsored study involving some 700 scientists and costing about $500 million reported in 1990 that " there is no evidence of a general or unusual decline of forests in the United States and Canada due to acid rain " and " there is no case of forest decline in which acidic deposition is known to be a predominant cause . " In Germany , Heinrich Spiecker , director of the Institute for Forest Growth , was commissioned by a Finnish forestry organization to assess the health of European forests . He concluded that they were growing faster and healthier than ever and had been improving throughout the 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 years ago , there 's never been a higher volume of wood ... than there is now , " Spiecker said . ( Ironically , one of the chief ingredients of acid rain -- nitrogen oxide -- breaks down naturally to become nitrate , a fertilizer for trees . ) As for lakes , it turned out that their rising acidity was likely caused more by reforestation than by acid rain ; one study suggested that the correlation between acidity in rainwater and the pH in the lakes was very low . The story of acid rain is not of catastrophe averted but of a minor environmental nuisance somewhat abated . <p> The threat to the ozone layer came next . In the 1970s scientists discovered a decline in the concentration of ozone over Antarctica during several springs , and the Armageddon megaphone was dusted off yet again . The blame was pinned on chlorofluorocarbons , used in refrigerators and aerosol cans , reacting with sunlight . The disappearance of frogs and an alleged rise of melanoma in people were both attributed to ozone depletion . So too was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1992 about blind salmon and rabbits , while The New York Times reported " an increase in Twilight Zone -type reports of sheep and rabbits with cataracts " in Patagonia . But all these accounts proved incorrect . The frogs were dying of a fungal disease spread by people ; the sheep had viral pinkeye ; the mortality rate from melanoma actually leveled off during the growth of the ozone hole ; and as for the blind salmon and rabbits , they were never heard of again . <p> There was an international agreement to cease using CFCs by 1996 . But the predicted recovery of the ozone layer never happened : The hole stopped growing before the ban took effect , then failed to shrink afterward . The ozone hole still grows every Antarctic spring , to roughly the same extent each year . Nobody quite knows why . Some scientists think it is simply taking longer than expected for the chemicals to disintegrate ; a few believe that the cause of the hole was misdiagnosed in the first place . Either way , the ozone hole can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one averted by political action . <p> Photos : Lars Baron/Getty ; Corbis ; Julie Dermansky/Corbis <p> Repeatedly throughout the past five decades , the imminent advent of a new pandemic has been foretold . The 1976 swine flu panic was an early case . Following the death of a single recruit at Fort Dix , the Ford administration vaccinated more than 40 million Americans , but more people probably died from adverse reactions to the vaccine than died of swine flu . <p> A few years later , a fatal virus did begin to spread at an alarming rate , initially through the homosexual community . AIDS was soon , rightly , the focus of serious alarm . But not all the dire predictions proved correct . " Research studies now project that one in five -- listen to me , hard to believe -- one in five heterosexuals could be dead from AIDS at the end of the next three years . That 's by 1990 . One in five , " Oprah Winfrey warned in 1987 . <p> Bad as AIDS was , the broad-based epidemic in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it did in Africa . In 2000 the US National Intelligence Council predicted that HIV/AIDS would worsen in the developing world for at least 10 years and was " likely to aggravate and , in some cases , may even provoke economic decay , social fragmentation and political destabilization in the hardest hit countries in the developing and former communist worlds . " <p> Yet the peak of the epidemic had already passed in the late 1990s , and today AIDS is in slow retreat throughout the world . New infections were 20 percent lower in 2010 than in 1997 , and the lives of more than 2.5 million people have been saved since 1995 by antiretroviral treatment . " Just a few years ago , talking about ending the AIDS epidemic in the near term seemed impossible , but science , political support , and community responses are starting to deliver clear and tangible results , " UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidib wrote last year . <p> The emergence of AIDS led to a theory that other viruses would spring from tropical rain forests to wreak revenge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the implication of Laurie Garrett 's 1994 book , The Coming Plague : Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance . The most prominent candidate was Ebola , the hemorrhagic fever that starred in Richard Preston 's The Hot Zone , published the same year . Writer Stephen King called the book " one of the most horrifying things I 've ever read . " Right on cue , Ebola appeared again in the Congo in 1995 , but it soon disappeared . Far from being a harbinger , HIV was the only new tropical virus to go pandemic in 50 years . <p> In the 1980s British cattle began dying from mad cow disease , caused by an infectious agent in feed that was derived from the remains of other cows . When people , too , began to catch this disease , predictions of the scale of the epidemic quickly turned terrifying : Up to 136,000 would die , according to one study . A pathologist warned that the British " have to prepare for perhaps thousands , tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human manifestation of mad cow coming down the line . " Yet the total number of deaths so far in the UK has been 176 , with just five occurring in 2011 and none so far in 2012 . <p> In 2003 it was SARS , a virus from civet cats , that ineffectively but inconveniently led to quarantines in Beijing and Toronto amid predictions of global Armageddon . SARS subsided within a year , after killing just 774 people . In 2005 it was bird flu , described at the time by a United Nations official as being " like a combination of global warming and HIV/AIDS 10 times faster than it 's running at the moment . " The World Health Organization 's official forecast was 2 million to 7.4 million dead . In fact , by late 2007 , when the disease petered out , the death toll was roughly 200 . In 2009 it was Mexican swine flu . WHO director general Margaret Chan said : " It really is all of humanity that is under threat during a pandemic . " The outbreak proved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a new global pandemic is growing less likely , not more . Mass migration to cities means the opportunity for viruses to jump from wildlife to the human species has not risen and has possibly even declined , despite media hype to the contrary . Water- and insect-borne infections -- generally the most lethal -- are declining as living standards slowly improve . It 's true that casual-contact infections such as colds are thriving -- but only by being mild enough that their victims can soldier on with work and social engagements , thereby allowing the virus to spread . Even if a lethal virus does go global , the ability of medical science to sequence its genome and devise a vaccine or cure is getting better all the time . <p> Of all the cataclysmic threats to human civilization envisaged in the past 50 years , none has drawn such hyperbolic language as people themselves . " Human beings are a disease , a cancer of this planet , " says Agent Smith in the film The Matrix . Such rhetoric echoes real-life activists like Paul Watson of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intelligently reduce human populations to fewer than one billion ... Curing a body of cancer requires radical and invasive therapy , and therefore , curing the biosphere of the human virus will also require a radical and invasive approach . " <p> On a " stinking hot " evening in a taxi in Delhi in 1966 , as Paul Ehrlich wrote in his best seller , The Population Bomb , " the streets seemed alive with people . People eating , people washing , people sleeping . People visiting , arguing , and screaming . People thrusting their hands through the taxi window , begging . People defecating and urinating . People clinging to buses . People herding animals . People , people , people , people . " Ehrlich 's conclusion was bleak : " The train of events leading to the dissolution of India as a viable nation " was already in progress . And other experts agreed . " It is already too late to avoid mass starvation , " said Denis Hayes , organizer of the first Earth Day in 1970 . Sending food to India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Paul Paddock wrote in their best seller , Famine -- 1975 ! <p> What actually happened was quite different . The death rate fell . Famine became rarer . The population growth rate was cut in half , thanks chiefly to the fact that as babies stop dying , people stop having so many of them . Over the past 50 years , worldwide food production per capita has risen , even as the global population has doubled . Indeed , so successful have farmers been at increasing production that food prices fell to record lows in the early 2000s and large parts of western Europe and North America have been reclaimed by forest . ( A policy of turning some of the world 's grain into motor fuel has reversed some of that decline and driven prices back up . ) <p> Meanwhile , family size continues to shrink on every continent . The world population will probably never double again , whereas it quadrupled in the 20th century . With improvements in seeds , fertilizers , pesticides , transport , and irrigation still spreading across Africa , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from fewer acres than it now uses to feed 7 billion . <p> Photo : Jo Yong Hak/Reuters ; Ian hanning/Redux <p> In 1977 President Jimmy Carter went on television and declared : " World oil production can probably keep going up for another six or eight years . But sometime in the 1980s , it ca n't go up anymore . Demand will overtake production . " He was not alone in this view . The end of oil and gas had been predicted repeatedly throughout the 20th century . In 1922 President Warren Harding created the US Coal Commission , which undertook an 11-month survey that warned , " Already the output of natural gas has begun to wane . Production of oil can not long maintain its present rate . " In 1956 , M. King Hubbert , a Shell geophysicist , forecast that gas production in the US would peak at about 14 trillion cubic feet per year sometime around 1970 . <p> All these predictions failed to come true . Oil and gas production have continued to rise during the past 50 years . Gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers learned how to exploit abundant shale gas . In 2011 the International Energy Agency estimated that global gas resources would last 250 years . Although it seems likely that cheap sources of oil may indeed start to peter out in coming decades , gigantic quantities of shale oil and oil sands will remain available , at least at a price . Once again , obstacles have materialized , but the apocalypse has not . Ever since Thomas Robert Malthus , doomsayers have tended to underestimate the power of innovation . In reality , driven by price increases , people simply developed new technologies , such as the horizontal drilling technique that has helped us extract more oil from shale . <p> It was not just energy but metals too that were supposed to run out . In 1970 Harrison Brown , a member of the National Academy of Sciences , forecast in Scientific American that lead , zinc , tin , gold , and silver would all be gone by 1990 . The best-selling book The Limits to Growth was published 40 years ago by the Club of Rome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Italy . The book forecast that if use continued to accelerate exponentially , world reserves of several metals could run out by 1992 and help precipitate a collapse of civilization and population in the subsequent century , when people no longer had the raw materials to make machinery . These claims were soon being repeated in schoolbooks . " Some scientists estimate that the world 's known supplies of oil , tin , copper , and aluminum will be used up within your lifetime , " one read . In fact , as the results of a famous wager between Paul Ehrlich and economist Julian Simon later documented , the metals did not run out . Indeed , they grew cheaper . Ehrlich , who claimed he had been " goaded " into the bet , growled , " The one thing we 'll never run out of is imbeciles . " <p> Over the past half century , none of our threatened eco-pocalypses have played out as predicted . Some came partly true ; some were averted by action ; some were wholly chimerical . This raises a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , why should people accept the cataclysmic claims now being made about climate change ? After all , 2012 marks the apocalyptic deadline of not just the Mayans but also a prominent figure in our own time : Rajendra Pachauri , head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , who said in 2007 that " if there 's no action before 2012 , that 's too late ... This is the defining moment . " <p> So , should we worry or not about the warming climate ? It is far too binary a question . The lesson of failed past predictions of ecological apocalypse is not that nothing was happening but that the middle-ground possibilities were too frequently excluded from consideration . In the climate debate , we hear a lot from those who think disaster is inexorable if not inevitable , and a lot from those who think it is all a hoax . We hardly ever allow the moderate " lukewarmers " a voice : those who suspect that the net positive feedbacks from water vapor in the atmosphere are low , so that we face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that the Greenland ice sheet may melt but no faster than its current rate of less than 1 percent per century ; that net increases in rainfall ( and carbon dioxide concentration ) may improve agricultural productivity ; that ecosystems have survived sudden temperature lurches before ; and that adaptation to gradual change may be both cheaper and less ecologically damaging than a rapid and brutal decision to give up fossil fuels cold turkey . <p> We 've already seen some evidence that humans can forestall warming-related catastrophes . A good example is malaria , which was once widely predicted to get worse as a result of climate change . Yet in the 20th century , malaria retreated from large parts of the world , including North America and Russia , even as the world warmed . Malaria-specific mortality plummeted in the first decade of the current century by an astonishing 25 percent . The weather may well have grown more hospitable to mosquitoes during that time . But any effects of warming were more than counteracted by pesticides , new antimalarial drugs , better drainage , and economic development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these trends will continue , whatever the weather . <p> Just as policy can make the climate crisis worse -- mandating biofuels has not only encouraged rain forest destruction , releasing carbon , but driven millions into poverty and hunger -- technology can make it better . If plant breeders boost rice yields , then people may get richer and afford better protection against extreme weather . If nuclear engineers make fusion ( or thorium fission ) cost-effective , then carbon emissions may suddenly fall . If gas replaces coal because of horizontal drilling , then carbon emissions may rise more slowly . Humanity is a fast-moving target . We will combat our ecological threats in the future by innovating to meet them as they arise , not through the mass fear stoked by worst-case scenarios . <p> Matt Ridley ( rationaloptimist.com ) is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal and the author , most recently 
##44652 <p> WWE returned to the USA network for Monday Night Raw last night ( Nov. 12 , 2012 ) from Columbus , Ohio featuring the go home show to the Survivor Series pay-per-view ( PPV ) event this weekend . <p> And the return of Jerry Lawler ! <p> This show has received a mix of good , bad , and baffled reviews , and now it 's my turn to sink my teeth in . Let 's get right to it , ladies and sirs . <p> There 's an entirely different post on the front page ( as of 6:10 a.m . CT , at least ) detailing in depth my feelings on how WWE handled Jerry Lawler 's return to Raw . The short version for this bullet point is that his promo was heartfelt and created the feel good moment of the year , CM Punk 's ensuing heel promo was arguably one of the best he 's ever done , and WWE was brilliant in its use of the situation to get heat for its champion who has struggled to find the hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces with Paul Heyman . All that was fine , and not only fine but amazing . Then , WWE aired the footage of cameras filming the paramedics rushing to save Lawler 's life and it was sickening . Read more about all that in the other post . <p> I was surprised to see that Jim Ross was used only to buy time so WWE could make a big production about bringing Lawler out in a prime time slot . I do n't have a problem with it but I expected Ross would be there the entire night for support . No one could have known that " The King " would jump back in and hardly miss a beat , which is exactly what he managed to pull off . Seriously , this man was dead two months ago and now he 's back and looking almost as good as he did before and doing his job almost as well . That 's pretty fucking amazing and I 'm glad it worked out this way . <p> There 's an argument to be made that WWE should start every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last night , Randy Orton and Dolph Ziggler put together a solid singles match before it turned into a tag team affair that included Kofi Kingston and Alberto Del Rio , a mini preview to the elimination match at Survivor Series this weekend . The crowd was into it and found it easy to get up for the action inside the ring . Had this been a promo and it bombed , the crowd may not have ever recovered , and that 's a very real problem in the three-hour era . Kudos to the Nationwide Arena folks who were hot all throughout the night . I 'm crediting that , at least partially , to opening the show with a good match . <p> Perhaps proving my point was the ensuing segment between Vickie Guerrero and AJ Lee with the new " evidence " that AJ is boning down with John Cena . At this point , because Lee is no longer in power , would it even matter ? Anyway , the evidence presented was flimsy and I came away feeling like the creative team stole this entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hard as any angle has been bombed in Orlando at the Impact Zone , WWE could get it over with bigger stars and better execution . That has n't even come close to happening and one need only read the Raw live blog thread to know how fans feel about this program . Look for the collective cringe in the comments section . <p> To cap off this dumb shit angle , it looks AJ is going to fall for Cena , like she fell for Punk , Daniel Bryan , and Kane before him . Because remember , folks , if you 're a women who works in WWE , you must be a slut . <p> I know Big Show and Sheamus are primarily SmackDown talents but they were featured so little on this show I forgot they have a world heavyweight championship match in just six days at the PPV . That 's not the worst thing in the world because , again , they have an entire show on Friday night to make up for that but you would think they would get more time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , though . <p> Going back to the Lawler-Punk segment , how awesome was Mick Foley ? When that dude gets a solid talking point and really sinks his teeth into a subject , he destroys it with the fire of 1,000 suns . He 's just about shot as a pro wrestling performer but damned if he ca n't still bring the torch every now and again and burn the ring to the ground using only that microphone . <p> The eight man tag team match was one of the most fun tag team matches I 've seen in a long time . We all waited and wondered why reports kept coming out that Triple H was going to save the tag team division and all that happened was Kofi Kingston and R-Truth came together and won the belts before never defending them and losing in singles matches on every show . Now , we 've got legitimate teams that are highly entertaining and if they put on matches like this to help pace shows in between promo segments , crowds across America wo n't have as much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool matches instead of dissect storylines and angles and promos and all that other shit . <p> Paul Heyman and Brad Maddox were seen plotting and planning prior to the latter 's match against Ryback with a $1 million contract on the line . That was a set up for something somewhere down the line but it was n't for anything last night . Ryback systematically destroyed Maddox , hit his finishers , got the pin , destroyed him after the bell , threw him into an ambulance , and walked away . Just like that . So either Heyman told Maddox to let that happen in exchange for something later , or ... well ... okay , I do n't have clue one what the hell that was or where the hell it 's going . Maybe a run-in at Survivor Series where Maddox costs Ryback the belt again and that 's how Punk retains for this PPV ? <p> The most entertaining part about the Maddox stuff last night was watching June react to him getting beat . He shows up on television and it 's like nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there until he 's no longer on it . She even audibly gasped when Ryback hit the first powerbomb , which really was particularly brutal . Who knows how talented he is as a wrestler ( we did n't get to see last night ) or a performer on a larger scale but the ladies -- or at least my lady -- think he 's swell . <p> I 'd like to point out to you that Tensai used to have Lord in front of his name and he beat John Cena in a Raw main event months ago . That happened . <p> If R-Truth started every single promo with a knock knock joke , I would n't hate it . I really would n't . <p> Why is everyone so surprised The Miz won that poll against Zack Ryder and Santino Marella to be partnered with Kane and join Team Foley ? WWE would never fudge a poll , we know that much . What must have happened is Ryder 's fans simply did n't want him teaming up with Kane because they do n't want him to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CoBro marks who made sure Miz won . Obviously . <p> Face Miz is going to be so bad . <p> Was anyone else surprised to see Cena and Punk go so hard in the main event ? They worked a main event style match with a big spot or two thrown in and kept the crowd into it the entire way . This was a great match to close the go home show to Survivor Series , and Cena getting the pin really sets up the fact that he 's not getting it this weekend . <p> This was an outstanding show with my only real complaint being the continued garbage put out in the AJ-Cena-Vickie-Ziggler program . I mean , at least Claire Lynch was an awesomely bad actor we could all laugh at . <p> This is just sad . <p> Even with that segment dragging it down , this was an awesome edition of Raw . <p> Grade : A <p> That 's it from me , Cagesiders . Now it 's time for you to

##58950 <h> Review G-Dragon ' One of a Kind ' <h> Share this Story <p> GD is back and all by himself again ... sort of . While G-Dragon is often lauded as a talented songwriter and producer , he pointed out earlier this year that he 's never actually released an entirely self-written song . That 's perfectly fine with me- GD shines as a collaborator , and this album just reaffirms his talents . For anyone expecting ' Heartbreaker ' Part 2- you 'll be disappointed . In the video for " One of a Kind " , GD smashes tennis balls at glass cases containing his ' Heartbreaker ' costumes , letting us know that he has moved on from that stage in his life . <p> Our first preview of the album , " One of a Kind " , left me a little cold . As a track , it 's not bad , but it did n't blow me away or anything . The whole wanna-be-gangsta ' image feels very fake , and the lines about being " young and rich " put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , it 's because they fought their way up from nothing- GD comes from a relatively privileged background , so the bragging about money seems a little bratty . <p> I did n't have my hopes up too high for " That xx " , but GD totally surpassed my expectations with a soft , acoustic song and a gorgeous music video . While his voice is n't particularly strong , it suits the song perfectly- one of GD 's strengths is that he knows how to work with what he has . The decision to tell the story in the video through a non-linear plot was a bit risky , but I ca n't imagine a better way to tell that story . One question- if the guy knows he 's an " xx " , why does n't he do something about it instead of just singing about it ? <p> The third video and lead single is the overwhelmingly eccentric " Crayon " . I like the chorus and the rapping is fun , but the beeping in the verses started to grate on me pretty quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do n't think I 'd listen to it in my day-to-day life . As for the video- there 's just so ... much ... stuff . I 'm still not sure how I feel about it . However , that 's what 's kind of cool about GD 's solo work- he does more commercial stuff with Big Bang , and gets to go all out with his personal artistic vision as as a solo act . <p> GD has said that " In the End " , featuring a mystery girl from YG Entertainment , is the most commercial song he 's ever done- while that may be true , that does n't mean the song is boring . I love how the intro just kind of wanders and ignores typical meter , and how the very open , bright sound of the music accompanies a sad story about falling out of love but not being able to get over the relationship . The processing on GD 's vocals is a bit overdone , but otherwise , I really like the song . Mystery Girl has a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds an extra dimension to the track . <p> " Missing You " , featuring Kim Yuna of Jaurim , has a kind of indie rock feel to it that we 've never heard from GD before , and he pulls it off really well . We get to hear some of his lower vocal register , which sounds better than I expected- I thought he was Taeyang for a second at 2:24 ! Kim Yuna 's voice is lovely and she was the perfect pick for this song . <p> Kim Jongwan of Nell has a really nice falsetto tone , so I was happy to hear it in " Today " . I like songs that keep the arrangement interesting , but this seemed like it jumped around too much at first . It took a few listens , but the song has grown on me . While I could n't take a whole album of this type of song , I do think it 's a good way to end this section of the album . I was not expecting this or " Missing You " from G-Dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole indie rock style even further in the future . <p> " Light it Up " featuring Tablo and Dok2 is n't really my thing- like with " Crayon " , there 's a noise in the background that really turns me off to the song . It feels like a grungier , more cynical version of " The Leaders " ( featuring 2NE1 ' s CL and Teddy ) from GD 's last solo album . However , the lyrics give us a glimpse into the rappers ' angrier sides , with Tablo and GD addressing those who 've publicly wronged them in the past , and I can appreciate hearing them verbally shoot down people who attack them for no good reason . <p> All in all , I love that GD 's still experimenting . In " One of a Kind " , " Crayon " , and " Today " , he says things about being young and having fun , and I think that that 's the real concept behind this album- he 's not ready to settle into any one image yet . I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially because he really seems to be enjoying himself with this round of promotions- he looked so happy the first time he performed " Crayon " !

Due to the cooperation of DRC authorities , the French government and MONUC , Lubanga was transferred to The Hague on the same day . <p> The crimes for which Lubanga has been charged with are listed as war crimes under Articles 8(2) ( b ) ( xxvi ) or 8(2) ( e ) ( vii ) of the Rome Statute of the ICC . <p> The Prosecutor of the ICC has charged Thomas Lubanga Dyilo with the war crime of enlisting children under the age of fifteen ; conscripting children under the age of fifteen ; and using children under the age of fifteen to participate actively in hostilities . <p> FIRST APPEARANCE <p> On 20 March 2006 , Thomas Lubanga Dyilo first appeared in Court before ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I. <p> The Chamber found sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that Lubanga is criminally responsible as a co-perpetrator for the charges made against him for the period beginning September 2002 , when the Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded , and ending 13 August 2003 . <p> FIRST STAY OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND REVIVAL OF THE TRIAL <p> On 13 June 2008 , the Court announced a stay of the proceedings in the Lubanga case because the Prosecution was unable to make available potentially exculpatory materials . The Prosecutor had obtained the evidence in question on a confidential basis from several sources , including the UN , and these sources had refused to disclose it to the Defence and , in most cases , to the Trial Chamber . During a hearing on 24 June 2008 , Trial Chamber I stated that it would be premature to consider the release of the accused at this stage . <p> On 2 July 2008 , Trial Chamber I issued an order granting unconditional release to Thomas Lubanga Dyilo . The Prosecution appealed the order which was given suspensive effect , meaning that the accused shall not leave detention until the Appeals Chamber has resolved the issue . <p> On 3 September 2008 , ICC Trial Chamber I decided to maintain the stay of the proceedings in the Lubanga case . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrably fail to meet the prerequisites set out hitherto by the Chamber to enable it to lift the stay of proceedings , and they infringe fundamental aspects of the accused 's right to a fair trial ? . Lubanga will however remain in custody until a final decision is taken by the ICC Appeals Chamber on the appeal of the order granting him unconditional release . <p> On 14 October 2008 , the Prosecution decided to discontinue the first and second grounds of his Appeal against the Trial Chamber ? s decision to stay the proceedings . According to the Prosecution , information providers now agree to allow complete access to all the Article 54(3) ( e ) documents by both the Trial Chamber and the Appeals Chamber , if necessary . This notice does not affect the third ground in that appeal , on the imposition of the stay of trial , nor does it affect the appeals from the decisions to release the accused . <p> The Court has held multiple hearings in preparation for the Lubanga trial . With decisions on the participation of victims in the trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents , the role of the Office of Public Counsel for Victims , the Court has been setting key guidelines on many crucial issues . <p> TRIAL <p> On 26 January 2009 , the ICC opened its first trial in the case against Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga Dyilo . <p> The Prosecution , the Defence , the Registry and 8 Legal Representatives of Victims representing 93 victims are participating in trial hearings . <p> The Prosecution finished the presentation of its case in mid-July 2009 . <p> The presentation of the Defense ? s case ? originally scheduled to start in October 2009 ? had been adjourned pending a ruling by the Appeals Chamber on the recharacterization of the facts and the addition of charges of sexual slavery and inhuman and/or cruel treatment to the existing charges . On 8 December 2009 , the Appeals Chamber of the ICC reversed the Trial Chamber decision on the reclassification of the facts in the Lubanga case . <p> On 7 January 2010 , the Lubanga trial resumed with the testimonies of two experts and three victims . The Defense then started the presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On 8 July 2010 ICC Trial Chamber I ordered to stay the proceedings in the case The Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo , considering that the fair trial of the accused was no longer possible due to non-implementation of the Chamber 's orders by the Prosecution . The Chamber had ordered the Office of the Prosecutor to confidentially disclose to the Defence the identity of intermediary 143 . <p> On 15 July 2010 , ICC Trial Chamber I ordered the release of Thomas Lubanga . ICC judges argued that an accused can not be held in preventative custody on a speculative basis , namely that at some stage in the future the proceedings may be resurrected . However , the order was not implemented with immediate effect . The Prosecution appealed the decision and the request was granted suspensive effect meaning Thomas Lubanga remained in detention until the Appeals Chamber made a final decision . <p> On 8 October 2010 , the ICC Appeals Chamber reversed Trial Chamber I ? s July 2010 decision to stay proceedings and to release the accused . Appeals judges stated that although the prosecutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to protection issues , judges should first have tried applying sanctions before imposing the drastic measure of a stay of proceedings . The trial resumed but was again put on hold for 6 weeks in early 2011 due to various challenges brought by the defense , in particular regarding the disclosure of the identity of witnesses and participating victims . On 23 February 2011 , Trial Chamber I rejected another defense application for a stay of proceedings and the trial resumed on 21 March 2011 . On 20 May 2011 , Trial Chamber I ordered the closing of the presentation phase of evidence . <p> END OF TRIAL PHASE <p> On 25 and 26 August 2011 , the closing statements took place before TC I. The Prosecution and the Defence presented their final arguments . The legal representatives of victims also made statements at the final hearings . A total of 123 victims were authorized to participate during the trial . Through their legal representative , these victims expressed their position on matters heard before the chamber and were authorized to examine witnesses on specific issues . On 15 December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authoritative version of the judgment in English in the case , with the French translation to follow a number of weeks later . <p> VERDICT <p> In a public hearing on 14 March 2012 , TC I delivered a guilty verdict against Lubanga . He was found guilty of having committed the war crimes of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of 15 years and using them to participate actively in hostilities in the DRC between September 2002 and August 2003 . Lubanga ? s defense has the right to appeal the decision . 129 victims participated in the trial through their legal representatives . <p> SENTENCING <p> On 13 June , TC I heard aggravating and mitigating factors to determine the sentence to be imposed . The prosecutor has requested a 30 year sentence , or 20 years should Lubanga submit a genuine apology and commit to working to prevent future crimes and promote peace . <p> On 10 July 2012 , TC I sentenced Lubanga to 14 years imprisonment . The some six years Lubanga has already served in detention in The Hague since March 2006 has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be deducted from the total sentence . <p> REPARATIONS PRINCIPLES AND PROCESS <p> On 7 August 2012 , TC I issued its first ever decision on the principles for victims ' reparations for harm suffered as a consequence of the crimes committed by Lubanga . The judges set out what the basis would be for the reparations award , as well as what the process would look like to come to the actual award . TC I decided that the Trust Fund for Victims ( TFV ) will collect reparations proposals from victims , which will then be approved by the Chamber . <p> DETENTION <p> Lubanga is currently detained in one of the 12 ICC cells of the ? Haaglanden Prison ? , in Scheveningen in The Hague since 17 March 2006 . The Scheveningen prison is located less than twenty minutes by road from the Court . The International Committee of the Red Cross visits the Detention Centre regularly .

##67351 <h> The map is not the territory <h> From Lesswrongwiki <p> The map is not the territory metaphorically illustrates the differences between belief and reality . The phrase was coined by Alfred Korzybski . Our perception of the world is being generated by our brain and can be considered as a ' map ' of reality written in neural paterns . Reality exists outside our mind but we can construct models of this ' territory ' based on what we glimpse through our senses . <p> The methaphor is useful for illustrating several ideas in a more intuitive way : <p> Scribbling on the map does not change the territory : If you change what you believe about an object , that is a change in the pattern of neurons in your brain . The real object will not change because of this edit . Granted you could act on the world to bring about changes to it but you ca n't do that by simply believing it to be a different way . For example , you could send a ball to the other side of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball across the field by believing it is on the other side of the field ( unless you are connected to a machine that scans your brain an kicks the ball when you believe it 's on the other side , but let 's not be pedantic ) . The strategy that normally gives most control over reality is one where the ' map ' is aligned to match the ' territory ' as closely as possible . This way you can create accurate models and predict what will happen as a consequence of your actions . eg : If you know where the ball is , and you know what will happen if you kick it , and you want it on the other side of the field you can decide to kick it to achieve the desired end state of ball being across the field . Wishing the ball across the field would be futile . For some strange reasons ( but explainable at least in principle , nothing is strange if you truly understand it ) , humans are wired to sometimes let their beliefs slip into what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests . That is like erasing a mountain off a map because you would like to pass there or drawing an oasis on the map in a desert because you would like some water . <p> The map is a separate object from the territory and the map exists as an object inside the territory : The analogy incourages us to look from a frame of reference other than from the inside outward and hopefully realize that not only do we cause things to happen , and things cause other things to happen , but also things have caused us to be the way we are . For example , Why is the sky so blue and beautiful ? It must have been made like that just for me . It was made beautiful so that I would enjoy looking at it . Except it 's the other way around . The sky was not made to fit our sense of beauty , the sky was here before us , we have a sense of beauty that evolved to fit the sky because the sky happened to be blue !

##71950 <p> Disclaimer : Naruto is the property of Masashi Kishimoto and Tv tokyo . This is a purely fanwritten work , with which I make no money , and write only for the pleasure of myself and my readers . <p> a/n : Well , this is my first Gaara fic , well first Naruto fic ever , so please enjoy it and be nice . Luv ya ! REVIEW ! <p> July 08 : Minor Edits <p> Prologue <p> Cold , clear green eyes stared blankly up at the hospital ceiling . The attack on Konoha had failed , and he had just returned to Suna with his two siblings . The fight had taken so much out of him , not just physically , but mentally as well . Uzumaki Naruto ... he thought to himself . A boy who despite his fear , would do anything to protect the ones he loved . <p> ( flashback ) <p> " They 're my friends ! ! And if you hurt them any more , I 'll kick your sorry ass ! ! " the young blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger , concern , and determination . <p> ' Why does he want to protect these people so badly ? ' the Suna shinobi thought . Naruto 's eyes blazed with fury as they fixed on the young girl passed out on the tree . The shinning blue orbs then turned to his raven haired friend laying exhausted on the ground . The more he saw his friends suffer , the stronger his resolve to defeat Shukaku 's host became . <p> ( end ) <p> The twelve year old " monster of Suna " remembered clearly how vehemently his blond opponent had fought to protect Uchiha Sasuke and his Sakura-chan . Even as he fought the Konoha ninja , the red haired boy could not help but admire Naruto 's courage . His strength came from the love he had for those important to him . It was with that strength that Uzumaki Naruto had beaten all odds and defeated " Suna 's ultimate weapon " . The blond shinobi understood the pain of being a monster ... of being an outcast in his own village . He had felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a demon . He saw people run away from him in fear , and forbid their children to socialize with him because of the Nine-tails sealed inside . He suffered for a long time , alone , but he found people to accept and love him . He did everything in his power to protect those people . At first , the demon of Suna could not understand this immense desire to protect others . Now , however , it made more sense to him . Protecting the ones he loved is what made Naruto strong . Perhaps it was the blonde 's understanding of his pain that made Gaara calculate these words . <p> ( flashback ) <p> " I understand your pain so much it hurts , " the young blond boy said . His big blue eyes shined with pain that the monster of the sand knew all to well . Naruto continued to drag his exhausted body closer to the opposing shinobi . <p> " But those people saved me from that hell . They accepted me as I was and acknowledged my existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to kill you , " his weary , yet determined voice declared . His eyes showed his tired state , but they were so strong . He was so strong , all because of them . Friends ... people who are important . <p> ( end ) <p> The shinobi 's pale green eyes glanced around his stark white hospital room . He was attached to a few machines , and was covered in a thin sheet . The walls were so white that the light from the intense sun of Sunagakure became blinding against it . It smelled of sickness , medication , and sanitizer . The young nurse in the room moved quickly and efficiently . His black rimmed eyes fell on her . He hesitated a moment , unsure or more afraid of what her reaction would be to his voice . <p> " Water , " he managed to say . The young woman nearly jumped out of her skin at the sound of his voice . Her wide , frightened brown eyes turned on him . A little sting in his heart caused him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that to him . Granted , he 'd created his own reputation after he 'd decided that he was alone , and he could trust no one . But , he was n't always that way . He was once an innocent child , however far off and distant the memory was . They had always reacted to him the same ; even when he just wanted to be normal . Even before he started to hate them they looked down on him . <p> He 'd began to hate them after the betrayal of his uncle . After his uncle , the one person he thought had n't hated him , tried to kill him . Yashamaru 's dying words ultimately turned this young ninja into a monster . They were hateful words , the one who said he did n't hate him , had truthfully hated him all along . The young boy let his dark lids fall over his cold eyes . ' I do n't want to be feared anymore , ' he thought as the nurse scrambled out of the room . He opened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A slight , dry breeze wafted into the room rustling the mess of red hair on his head . The hot sun blazed down on Suna today , just like most days . <p> ' Is there no chance of redemption for me ? Will I always be feared as an unstable monster ? ' he thought . An image of the blond shinobi who 'd unknowingly changed his life flashed through his thoughts . <p> ' One day I will be accepted too ... I will fight for those who are important to me ... brother ... sister ... and maybe one day friends .. I will .... me .. Sabaku no Gaara , ' he thought as the nurse nervously flitted in and out of the room . She left a glass of water in her wake . He watched as a small droplet of water traveled the length of the glass , then

##78450 <h> The road to language learning is iconic <p> Languages are highly complex systems and yet most children seem to acquire language easily , even in the absence of formal instruction . New research on young children 's use of British Sign Language ( BSL ) sheds light on one of the mechanisms - iconicity - that may endow children with this amazing ability . <p> For spoken and written language , the arbitrary relationship between a word 's form -- how it sounds or how it looks on paper -- and its meaning is a particularly challenging feature of language acquisition . But one of the first things people notice about sign languages is that signs often represent aspects of meaning in their form . For example , in BSL the sign EAT involves bringing the hand to the mouth just as you would if you were bringing food to the mouth to eat it . <p> In fact , a high proportion of signs across the world 's sign languages are similarly iconic , connecting human experience to linguistic form . <p> Robin Thompson and colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Deafness , Cognition and Language Research Centre ( DCAL ) at University College London in the United Kingdom wanted to examine whether this kind of iconicity might provide a key to understanding how children come to link words to meaning . <p> Their findings are published in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science . <p> The researchers looked at data from 31 deaf children who were being raised in deaf BSL signing families in the United Kingdom . Parents indicated the number of words understood and produced by their children between the ages of 8 and 30 months . The researchers decided to focus on 89 specific signs , examining children 's familiarity with the signs as well as the iconicity and complexity of the signs . <p> The findings reveal that younger ( 11-20 months ) and older ( 21-30 months ) children comprehended and produced more BSL signs that were iconic than those that were less iconic . And the benefit of iconicity seemed to be greater for the older children . Importantly , this relationship did not seem to depend on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Together , these findings suggest that iconicity could play an important role in language acquisition . <p> Thompson and colleagues hypothesize that iconic links between our perceptual-motor experience of the world and the form of a sign may provide an imitation-based mechanism that supports early sign acquisition . These iconic links highlight motor and perceptual similarity between actions and signs such as DRINK , which is produced by tipping a curved hand to the mouth and represents the action of holding a cup and drinking from it . <p> The researchers emphasize that these results can also be applied to spoken languages , in which gestures , tone of voice , inflection , and face-to-face communication can help make the link between words and their meanings less arbitrary . <p> " We suggest that iconicity provides scaffolding -- a middle-ground -- to bridge the " great divide " between linguistic form and bodily experience for both sign and spoken language learners 
##82850 <h> Pages <h> Thursday , May 12 , 2011 <h> Harman on Benatar 's Better Never to Have Been ( Part One ) <p> I had an interesting conversation the other day . It was about philosophers who seem to defend bizarre or controversial views . Unsurprisingly , David Benatar 's name came up . Benatar , in case you do n't know , is an anti-natalist . He thinks it is wrong to bring people into existence ( i.e. to procreate ) and he presents his view in a book called Better Never to Have Been . He 's not the only anti-natalist , but his book seems to have gained a high level of notoriety , perhaps given its publication by Oxford University Press . <p> Anyway , after that conversation , it occurred to me that although I was aware of the basic conclusion that Benatar defends , I knew next to nothing about his actual arguments . So I decided to do something to remedy this gap in my knowledge . Of course , ideally , I should have just read his book but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to seek out some commentary on it instead . The most helpful resource I discovered after an internet-based search was also one of the first I came across : It was the following : <p> Based on my reading , this seems like a fair , but critical philosophical analysis of Benatar 's book , and I want to summarise some its content here . I 'm also going to use it as my basis for trying to clarify Benatar 's arguments to myself . Obviously , the kind of analysis I 'm going to undertake is n't a replacement for reading Benatar 's original work , but what with time constraints and everything I think it is a reasonable place to start . <p> Before I get started I want to draw attention to one point . I do n't find anti-natalism as counter-intuitive as some people I have spoken to seem to do . Indeed , I suspect there are many ( actual ) cases in which procreation is morally circumspect , particularly if it is done without proper foresight and planning for the child 's future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all cases of procreation are morally circumspect and that existence is , in general , awful . Anti-natalists would have to do a lot to convince me of this . Let 's see if Benatar , filtered through the lens of Elizabeth Harman , is up to that task . <p> In this first part , I 'll just introduce Benatar 's two arguments . I 'll try to evaluate them in the second part . <p> 1 . Benatar 's First Argument <p> Benatar defends one basic conclusion using two , independent , lines of argument . The conclusion , as was hinted at above , is that procreation is , in all cases , wrong . What are the arguments ? We 'll develop versions of each below . Initially , we can note that both arguments rely on the generally accepted principle that it is wrong to harm someone ( although they might , as I will suggest , interpret that principle in slightly different ways ) . This principle has an obvious corollary , namely : it is morally right to benefit someone . <p> Benatar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone into existence one is harming them by causing all the bad aspects of their lives , but not benefitting them by causing all the good aspects of their lives . Incorporating this basic idea into our reasoning we can develop ( through some creative reading ) the following argument in favour of Benatar 's conclusion : <p> ( 1 ) It is morally wrong to harm a person . <p> ( 2 ) In bringing a person into existence one harms them by causing all the bad aspects of their lives , but one does not benefit them by causing all the good aspects of their lives . <p> ( 3 ) The act of procreation is the act of brining a person into existence . <p> ( 4 ) Therefore , in all cases , it is morally wrong to procreate . <p> Obviously , premise ( 2 ) is pretty crucial here and we 'll have to see what kind of argument Benatar can construct in its favour . One other thing to note is that in this argument the harm principle is phrased in a categorical or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm a person " - instead of in a non-absolute or consequentialist way . I 'm not sure , based on this one article , whether Benatar would agree with this reconstruction of the principle , but it seems appropriate given the kind of argument he offers in favour of premise ( 2 ) , which we 'll be considering later . That said , I think a non-absolute version could be substituted here without doing too much damage to our appreciation of the argument ( mainly because it seems to have other , more serious , defects ) . <p> 2 . Benatar 's Second Argument <p> Moving on , the second argument relies on a much more straightforward aggregative empirical claim about the overall goodness and badness of life . As follows : <p> ( 5 ) It is morally wrong to harm a person ( unless the harm achieves some outweighing benefit ) . <p> ( 6 ) All lives are overall very bad and not worth living . <p> ( 7 ) The act of procreation causes a person to have a life . <p> ( 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong to procreate . <p> Although this argument is pretty easy to follow , a couple of things need to be said about it here . <p> First , in her review , Harman says that Benatar only claims that " most lives are overall very bad " . I have changed that , in my reconstruction of the argument , to " all lives are overall very bad " . This comes in premise ( 6 ) . I made the change for the obvious reason that without it the strong conclusion that Benatar reaches does not follow . At best , the conclusion reached would be that most cases of procreation are morally wrong ( which , as noted in the intro , I might be willing to accept ) . Of course , this makes the argument more difficult to defend . <p> Second , as you can see , this argument relies on a consequentialist version of the harm principle . This version makes sense given the kind of aggregative claim embedded in premise ( 6 ) : if we were absolutists about the wrongness of harming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a meaningful exercise . <p> The consequentialist permission of some level of harm can be understood in different ways . In the argument given , all forms of harm are permitted if they lead to some greater good . This is a pretty weak requirement . A stronger version of the principle would stipulate that harm is only permitted if it is necessary for achieving some greater good . This should actually be familiar to anyone who read my series on skeptical theism and the problem of evil . There , the idea was that God could only allow whatever evils were ( logically ) necessary for achieving some greater good . <p> Again , based on reading just this one article , I have no idea how Benatar would like the principle to be understood . I 've opted for the weak version here . Again , as was the case with the first argument , I do n't think this matters too much because all the real philosophical action lies elsewhere . <p> 3 . Comments <p> Benatar 's two arguments are combined and illustrated in the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the arguments are supposed to provide independent lines of support for the same conclusion . This is significant since one of the arguments clearly provides stronger support for the conclusion than the other . It would be bad if it turned out that the stronger argument reduced to the weaker argument <p> Which argument is stronger ? Obviously , the first argument because it is an " in principle " argument . It states that , given the conceptual nature of harms and benefits , it is necessarily wrong to bring a person into existence . If this is true , it would be impossible to disagree . This stands in stark contrast to the second argument , which is a contingent , a posteriori argument . It states that , given the nature of existence as it currently stands , it is wrong to bring a person into existence . The weakness here is twofold : ( i ) this is an empirical claim that could be quite difficult to prove and ( ii ) the contingent facts could change such that existence ceases to be so harmful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Given the relative strengths of the arguments involved , and the practical difficulty in evaluating the second argument in this forum , the second part of this series will focus almost entirely on the first argument . <h> 2 comments : <p> I 'm amazed that people have the intellectual charity to engage with the argument on its own terms . <p> 1 . The second argument clearly requires some form of simple hedonism , or the view that " good " can be reliably equated with " pleasure " and " bad " with " pain " . This assumption is almost universally rejected in moral philosophy . Why allow it to operate here ? <p> 2 . Both arguments assume that your sincere judgments about the value of your life have no authority whatsoever , and that such judgments can be instantly overruled via rationalist conceptual analysis ( 1st argument ) or empirical " studies " ( 2nd argument ) . Very few philosophers working in value theory would accept this idea , as most believe that an agent 's sincere , reflective , factually informed value-judgments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments assume a bizarre and self-contradictory notion of value , yet , for some reason , people are engaging with Benatar as though his central term is well-defined .

##85351 <h> Tag Archives : point of view <p> ince I 'm trying to plan my WIP before I start putting fingers to keyboard , I 'm spending a lot of time thinking through overall arcs , individual scenes and how they 'll all fit together . An internal discussion that I had n't planned on has popped up : point of view . When I think of scenes one character is in , I think in first person , and when I think of scenes with a different , yet an equally important character in them , I think in third person . <p> Changing back and forth between first and third person would be jarring for the reader . And it would give one character more prominence ... something I do n't want to do . <p> Writing fiction in first person is difficult for me , so it might be a fun challenge , but I 'm worried about switching between heads . I would have to make each characters first-person descriptions and actions markedly different , and if I have trouble with first person when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> Soon after I started contemplating the finer points and problems of this WIP and POV , I picked up The Help . Talk about serendipitous . In case you have n't read the book , it switches between three characters ... all in first person . <p> When I looked the book up in Goodreads , I noticed quite a few bad and mediocre reviews . That surprised me . I was amazed at how fluid the story was when switching between character . As a reader , I knew exactly who was talking . Yes , when the chapters switched narrators , it was noted above the chapter number . However , I rarely looked at that and was able to tell by the tone . Time also flowed smoothly when another character took the storytelling reigns . <p> I loved The Help for the its use of first person alone . It gave me confidence that it could be done ... but I would have to know my characters very , very well right from the beginning . I would n't be able to learn about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories I 've worked on . It 's a fun discovery . However , since I 'm trying to plot everything out beforehand , I should probably also know their voices before I start . <p> There are scene where my two characters be together , but I have n't spent much time contemplating them yet . Perhaps when I do there will be an obvious choice . Perhaps the POV I naturally think in will be the one I use . <p> How do you decide your POV ? Until now , it 's always the POV that pops into my head when I think about the story . Do you play around with it ? Writing the scene from first , then third to see what works best ? <p> And , as long as I 'm asking questions , what do you think of stories that bounce between multiple first person narrators ? <p> Just when I was starting to temper my addiction and only play ever other train ride , they came out with an upgrade . Obviously that 's the best way to get people coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat , more achievements to tackle , but what really got me playing until my eyes were dry and I was seeing peashooters in my sleep was the role-reversal game . Their new mini game puts you as the zombies trying to beat the plants ... whereas before , you 're trying to defeat the zombies by planting zombie-killing plants . <p> I swear that when I planted plants , they did n't last as long as the ones that are being planted against me . The grass is always greener , right ? <p> At first this role reversal was weird . I felt icky playing for the wrong side ( yes , I know it 's a game ) , but the more I got into it , the better my strategy became in the regular game . I could better see what plants ( some that I 'd ignored ) could do . <p> This is kind of like what I did to Julia a while ago . While I did n't switch to the antagonists point of view , I did switch to focus on scene with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story as a whole . That helped me get past the problems I was having ... got me out of the rut and shook me loose from the grip of writer 's block . <p> Have you ever tried to view your story from the POV of the villain ? <p> Or for you PvZ players out there ... which is your favorite plant ? Hands down ,

##98150 <h> Friday , February 10 , 2012 <p> What a fascinating fellow Newt Gingrich is . A couple of Sundays ago George Will cleared his throat to weigh in on him , and I hung on every word . <p> Substitute host Jake Tapper had interviewed Gingrich in the opening minutes of ABC 's This Week With George Stephanopoulos . Afterward , Tapper asked Will to have his say . Will clearly expected the question , and he was ready for it . " Time is not Newt Gingrich 's friend , " Will intoned , " because the more time he has the more he talks , and the more he talks the more he says things -- as he just did here this morning . <p> " He said , ' I 'd love to be civil , but I 'm running against a maniacal liar , ' " Will went on . " Now that 's pretty strong language . " The next thing Will said was addressed to Tapper . " I do n't know if you 've ever told Longfellow 's nursery rhyme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl who had a little curl right in the middle of her forehead ... ' " <p> Longfellow <p> Omigod ! He was repeating my poem ! You see , memorization was never one of my strengths back in school , and standing before the class and reciting poetry by heart was a challenge I was n't sure I could meet . But then I came across these lines by Longfellow that inscribed themselves in my mind . I dared anyone to tell me they constituted anything less than a poem . <p> There was a little girl Who had a little curl Right in the middle of her forehead . And when she was good She was very , very good , And when she was bad she was horrid . <p> " Thank you very much , " I said , and sat down . It 's not the longest or noblest thing Longfellow ever wrote , but here alone I believe he flirted with perfection . He made his point and shut up , and often poets do n't . <p> Now here was George Will reciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever he wanted to call it . The point is , George Will also knew it by heart ! <p> " ... right in the middle of her forehead . When she was good she was very good indeed . And when she was bad she was horrid . <p> " And we 're at the horrid stage with Newt Gingrich , " Will concluded . <p> Very good indeed ! I could n't believe it . Wills was such a pedant he could n't bring himself to recite the poem the way Longfellow wrote it . I turned off the TV and headed upstairs to let the world know I had the goods on him . <p> But before I blogged and Facebooked and tweeted my scorn -- the standard revised handbook of digital self-promotion insists we do all three -- I looked for the poem online so I could link to the text . To my dumbfoundment , the first text I found had it Will 's way . Other sites had it my way . This disagreement was the least my discoveries . Various sites offered various additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For instance .... <p> One day she went upstairs , When her parents , unawares , In the kitchen were occupied with meals , And she stood upon her head In her little trundle-bed , And then began hooraying with her heels . <p> Her mother heard the noise , And she thought it was the boys A-playing at a combat in the attic ; But when she climbed the stair , And found Jemima there , She took and she did spank her most emphatic . <p> All these new verses was execrable , and there was grave doubt any was authentic . Worse , there was no consensus that even the first verse was authentic . What online commentary I came across was laced with skepticism that Longfellow had had anything to do with writing any part of the poem . It does n't sound remotely like anything else by Longfellow , scholars had noted , and I had to concede the point . <p> This is the forest primeval . The murmuring pines and the hemlocks , Bearded with moss , and in garments green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with voices sad and prophetic , <p> You can say about Hiawatha and Evangeline that neither is a bundle of laughs and Longfellow did n't wrap them up quicker than you hoped he would . But I 'd always supposed he simply wrote those on a bad day . Could it be he did n't write the-girl-with-the-curl at all ? What next ? Would I read that Edgar Allan Poe was not the author of " Eldorado , " another poem I proudly recited in class . <p> Gaily bedight , a gallant knight , In sunshine and in shadow ... <p> I turned to Amazon . The Children 's Own Longfellow was searchable , but my search for curl turned up nothing . Biographies I searched online made no mention of the poem . I came across this tantalizing reference in a long essay on Longfellow written 30 years ago by Chicago scholar Edward Wagenknecht ( since deceased ) . <p> " Everybody knows the famous doggerel , " wrote Wagenknecht , who was dealing with the superior " very , very good " version of the poem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His son Ernest claimed that he did , but none of the other members of the family seem to have agreed with him , and there is certainly no conclusive evidence . The one thing that is certain is that he did not write the other stanzas sometimes appended to it . There was a learned and probably conclusive discussion of the matter by Sidney Kramer in the 1946 volume of the Bibliographical Society of America Papers . " <p> In these days of algorithmic digital scholarship , it comes as a relief to discover there is some scholarship that is virtually impossible to access online . The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America are such a trove , and eventually it was necessary for a sympathetic librarian in Philadelphia to e-mail me a pdf of Kramer 's 24-page treatise : " There Was A Little Girl : Its First Printings , Its Authorship , Its Variants . " <p> I 'll cut to the core of Kramer 's research . It seems the first variant of the poem surfaced in about 1870 , its origins unclear . In 1880 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paid Longfellow a call . She would describe the visit in a book published two years later , The Home Life of Henry W. Longfellow : <p> A momentary lull gave me a chance to speak , and not interrupt . <p> " Yes , " said I , deliberately , when all had finished , " there is no accounting for the rubbish that will in spite of judicious weeding find its way to publicity ; the authors are never known , and perhaps it is as well . I can at present only call to mind one instance , under the head of poetry , which runs as follows : or " -- I stopped with an inquiring look around , and half hesitatingly ventured to retract my implied idea of repeating it . In vain -- an earnest " Pray go on , " " continue , " in which the professor 's voice was uppermost in the chorus , positively insisted on hearing the aforesaid " rubbish " ; clearing my throat , I began -- <p> " There was a little durl , And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her forehead , When she was dood , She was very dood indeed , But when she was bad she was horrid . " <p> I looked up triumphantly as the last line rang out . Depict , imagine , my confusion when the poet raised his eyes , and with a faint smile , said : " Why ! Those are my words , are they not , Annie , " turning to his youngest daughter , who at that moment was gracefully coming through the low window opening out on the terrace , at the same time repeating the identical rhythm that but a moment before I had signalized as a sample of " rubbish . " Miss Annie looked up laughingly , and said in her cheery voice , " Why , of course , papa , that comes in your nursery collection . Do n't you remember when Edith was a little girl and did n't want to have her hair curled , you took her up in your arms , and shaking your finger at her , commenced , " There was a little girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all laughed , and I in spite of my discomfiture , joined in the general merriment . <p> This passage did n't vanquish Kramer 's doubts . He points out that Longfellow has little to say here , and his few words come down to us secondhand and are hard to interpret . ( Was Longfellow saying he wrote the verse or simply that he recited it ? ) Annie , three years younger than Edith , would n't have any direct memory of what their father used to say to her big sister when she was tiny . Kramer also points out -- though perhaps apropos of nothing -- that Miss Roosevelt recited a baby talk version of the verse and Annie responded in plain English . <p> But if on the basis of this anecdote Kramer is n't so sure Longfellow actually admitted his authorship to Blanche Roosevelt Tucker , he acknowledges that she was sure . After she published her book the attribution began to take hold , and in 1922 it was reinforced when Longfellow 's son Ernest , born in 1845 , recalled in a memoir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his second daughter Edith , then a baby in his arms , that my father composed and sang to her the well-known lines ... " <p> Regrettably , the well-known lines Ernest Longfellow chose to repeat were the George Will variant . Kramer notes that the Ernest version is closer to the Miss Roosevelt version ( minus the baby-talk ) than it is " to the text most of us prefer . " He also notes " that the Longfellow girls did not wear curls on the forehead as a regular matter . " He acknowledges the view of skeptics who can not imagine that a poet of Longfellow 's standing would have trafficked in a rhyme like " forehead / horrid , " but allows that a poet capable of that travesty could easily have perpetrated the rhyming atrocities in the other verses . What Kramer does not say ( though I believe he was thinking it ) is that " forehead / horrid " is actually a terrific rhyme that delights children ( and George Will and me ) because it 's so silly -- but it only works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody believes Longfellow wrote two more verses is that those are two verses too many -- and even the author of Hiawatha ( in 22 chapters ) and Evangeline ( in ten sections and 163 verses ) would have known that . <p> What got me going on 
##100851 <p> The whispering over Mitt Romney 's choice of a running mate is getting louder , and along with it we are being treated to the sotto voce angst of the GOP establishment : Whatever else Mitt does , he would n't dare pick Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan , would he ? <p> Too risky , goes the Beltway chorus . His selection would make Medicare and the House budget the issue , not the economy . The 42-year-old is too young , too wonky , too , you know , serious . Beneath it all you can hear the murmurs of the ultimate Washington insult -- that Mr. Ryan is too dangerous because he thinks politics is about things that matter . That dude really believes in something , and we certainly ca n't have that . <p> All of which highly recommend him for the job . <p> Yes , Mitt . Listen to the Wall Street Journal . Pick Zombie-Eyed Granny Starver ( thank you Chuck Pierce ! ) Do it quickly so that we can have a good laugh and can get back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hands of Mitch McConnell . I 'm far more worried about the Senate than I am POTUS right now , but considering Romney has gotten bullied into everything else the nutjobs on the right want ( when he 's not already at the default nutjob position on that particular policy ) then yes , choose Ryan . <p> Do it . Robot/Zombie 2012 , fighting for the one percent . Lose with gusto ! <p> Ryan graduated from Joseph A. Craig High School in Janesville in 1988 .

There 's no difference between losing by a little or losing by a lot , so you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hope to hell it works out for you . I do n't think Ryan is risky enough , however . Pushing further right is n't going to change a damn thing . <p> On the upside , I think Ryan would be more receptive to being called a Hail Mary than Palin . <p> Nothing would please me more than a Ryan VP pick . Not just because they would lose , but because everyone who thought that lowering taxes meant MOAR FREE SHIT will have to cope with the fact that they 've had their heads up their asses since at least 1980 . <p> Ryan graduated from Joseph A.

It worked in Missouri . Claire McCaskill is now running against some guy ( Todd Akin , IIRC ) who claims that liberals hate God . <p> I do nt understand any of these potential picks . romney needs an attack dog ... someone to say the things Romney cant say because it might not appear presidential . That is the role Biden plays . In that vein , I would go with Santorum . He is no more or less crazy than Ryan . He throws bombs and he excites the base . that is what romney needs . <p> I think that all of the Ryan talk seriously underestimates Biden . The guy is much sharper than he gets credit for and his life story is still compelling . I like that contrast and I think Biden aggressively goes after the Granny-KillerT . <p> Who in their right mind would want to be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no chance of winning at this point . I 'm becoming convinced that Mitt 's just doing this to make even more money . Every month they claim he 's brought in more but spent less than Obama . There 's a big pile of cash sitting some where . <p> @ jrg : Nonsense . Not coping with facts is what the Right does best . Most of the media will absolutely run cover for Ryan 's claims that his plan of major tax cuts , defense spending increases , and cuts to spending on poors and browns is necessary and protects us from the deficit terror stalking our children . Fortunately , I think the left has developed the tools to push back on this a bit if it gets the spotlight attached to a place on the ticket . But Maddow and everyone else will need to earn their money on this one . The key is getting the rest of the village to at least give the issue their usual equivocal , " unbiased " coverage . If the story gets reported as " While Republicans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best plan ever , Liberals and facts say it could cut medicare " we 'll be fine . Our side might rack up a record number of pinocchios , but as long as the possibility of medicare cuts gets repeated airtime seniors will be on high alert . <p> I 'm trying to think when a VP pick made any real difference to the election . Maybe Kennedy/Johnson , cause Johnson helped bring in southern voters ? And Biden was seen to give a little experience to the ticket . But beyond that ....... <p> I think the Ryan pick makes some sense particularly after yesterdays little fustercluck . The Marquis Du Mittens is not seen as " one of us " by the wingnut freak show &; despite his desire to have stale weak tea white guy may feel that will not shore up the base the way it needs to be . It might allow him to slide back toward the mythical center ( just to the right of Mussolini ) . Still a win for the better side but he may have been forced into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan is too dangerous because he thinks politics is about things that matter . That dude really believes in something , and we certainly ca n't have that . <p> I find this line interesting . The Village is so utterly insulated , so closed to any opinions but those of the rich , that they actually think gutting the safety net so the rich do n't have to pay any taxes is what the country needs . They think it 's not just what benefits themselves , but good policy . Thus supporting Ryan stakes out the contrarian position of doing what 's right instead of what 's expedient , while something like Obamacare is both cheap pandering AND bad politics . <p> Please pick Ryan . We need to utterly destroy the GOP this fall , and Romney/Ryan is the perfect vehicle . <p> I love the false description the WSJ uses in endorsing Ryan . He 's too serious and wonky , he cares too much about policy , he believes in something , etc . No , the reason Rep. Ryan is so controversial is that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would destroy the economic security of millions of Americans , and most Americans are deeply opposed to his policy choices . <p> Putting Ryan on the ticket means that Mr. Romney can not avoid issues he 'd rather hide in the bushes , under the mattress or in the closet . <p> @ eric : Romney may need an attack dog , But he certainly does not want one . How gauche . He 'll pick T-Paw or some other white guy that nobody will recognize , because he ca n't stand the competition . I used to think that Ryan would be the one , but I think he 'd suck too much of what little oxygen there is left in the campaign . <p> But it would be nice if he picked someone who really reflects heartland American values , someone who could speak to true blue America . I nominate Louie Gohmert . <p> As yet another day passes , keep in mind that we still know more about the surface of Mars than we do about Mitt Romney 's tax returns , or about whatever-the-fuck he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curiousity Score for today reads NASA : 1 US Press : 0 <p> @ Maude : I totally agree he 's a shitty governor ( I live across the river in Philadelphia , so I get to see more of him than I 'd like to ) ; I just do n't think he 's stupid . NJ 's unemployment rate is over 9% , while PA 's is 7+% ; he fucked up the deal for a new connection to NYC , pretending it would be too expensive ; and on and on . Unlike a true-blue Tea Party guy , though , I think he knows it 's all bullshit and just does n't care -- more sociopath than moran . <p> @ lacp : it has to be someone that has no other real job because they are gon na lose and it would be a carrier killer , so that is why i think christie and ryan are really out . Ryan has a job for life as the number one gop in the house for economics . that pays well in a assortment of ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticizing the anti-Romney ad . Davis should thank God for Ralph Reed , because he is about the only person more unprincipled than Davis is . Here 's a good chronicle of what a piece of shit he is : <p> You can also add Greg Sargent to the list of liberal handwringers about the Priorities USA ad . Jesus , you 'd think that after spending the last 4 years hearing about death panels , pulling the plug on grandma , Obama 's deficit spending destroying the universe , the dozens of personal smears of Obama , Fast and Furious bullshit , the debt ceiling treason , etc. that guys on our side would be willing to tolerate a few arguably low blows ( that are a trifle compared to the mountains of lies and bullshit thrown at Obama and the Dems ) in the interest of winning this fucking election . Save the pious tsk-tsking until the victory parties are over , you wankers . <p> Who in their right mind would want to be on the ticket with Mittens ? Its a lot of work with no chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do it . He 's a pretty invisible guy and probably thinks he can just go back to a state office in Ohio and melt back into the wood work once the whole embarrassing mess is over . he wo n't be as fun as the other potential candidates though . He 's kind of the Chauncey Gardiner of Ohio politics . <p> Okay . How about instead of all the rest of this , we consider that choosing the tail end of the Ayn Rand Paul Ryan Human Centipede for a VP candidate would potentially put a Randroid a heartbeat from the Oval Office . <p> Mittens could nominate Jesus as his veep candidate and still could n't buy any love from wingnuts . They regard him as a RINO now just as they did in the primaries , and from what I can tell they 're feeling even less warm now than they did then . <p> Comrades , we must eliminate every trace of the running dog crapitalist vermin .

##107051 <p> We are , and we are not , our past . The deeds we 've done , the people we 've been -- there 's facets of who we are . They are not the whole picture . And yet , a recovering alcoholic is always a recovering alcoholic . You carry it with you . There are things that each of us carry with us , too -- little red wagons filled with crap . Some red wagons are small . Others are like dump trucks . And yet , again : that 's only part of the story . Our story . <p> Eventually , in some way , our past has a way of reemerging , of coloring our present , of rattling our cage . Our past is n't our reflection . It 's the shadow you see out of the corner of your eye , the ghost that 's maybe there or not . You turn , and it vanishes -- but that glimpse is enough to remind you . <p> Last night 's episode of Scandal ( Spies like Us ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olivia is dating her ex-fiance , who verbally spar with each other , but it 's more like friends . There 's no passion , no tension . There 's the end of the date and a shut door . Then there 's Huck , who is involved with a regular girl . Out of habit , he wants to run a background check . He does n't know what normal is , and Olivia has to talk him down off that ledge . There 's Cyrus , whose husband is back at the White House as a writer , and James makes a serious breach of trust -- quoting a conversation that Cyrus and he had in bed together , while not revealing his name . The article is about Hollis , the shady shark of a man who lords his swaggering leverage over the cabal of five ( Hollis , Mellie , Liv , Cyrus , and Verna ) like a malicious child . This article could be bad for everybody . <p> Of course , the central issue in this episode is Huck 's past -- the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened with exposure . At first , to protect Liv , he tries to flee . Instead , Olivia butts heads with him , and says that this is HER wheelhouse . He agrees to let her try to fix it . Cue a bunch of trigger happy , trust-deficient spies showing up to Pope and Associates . I have to admit , I laughed a bit when one turned out to be a soccer mom . It turns out one of the spies is a traitor , selling their identities to a hacker . Huck sends his coworkers home in an effort to find out who it is . One of the assassins is , almost hilariously , the one who Huck went to town on last season -- and who killed Amanda Tanner . <p> Harrison finally confronts Olivia about the emotional mess of a person she 's been since Steven left . He found her staring off into space , as per her current usually , looking wounded and doe-eyed . Her expressions are enough to break your heart . This separation with Fitz is eating away at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's doing the " right " thing , but it 's killing her . " It 's getting weird in here . What do you need ? " he asks . That is what Steven used to ask . Harrison goes to bat for Olivia , as her friend . Because he sees her in pain . " Whatever 's it is that 's going on , whatever it is that you 're thinking about when you 're sitting in here by all by yourself , tell me what you need and I will do it , no matter what . " He continues with an impassioned , convincing monologue that resonated with me . Because at someone point , everyone need to hear this , " I am your family . I am your gladiator . And that is not a job to me , that 's who I am . Right now , you need me . So , no questions asked . No matter what . Whatever you need . Gim me some marching orders , Liv . " Olivia tells him that Abby and David Rosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him why . But that Abby 's husband used to beat her , and he should use that angle . Again , this is where the past meets the present like a tide ugly with pollution . Harrison is ruthless , and I think that it takes a toll on him . He 's not a bad guy , but he 's not used to getting his hands dirty . He 's not used to damaging people close to him , even if it 's for the " right " reasons . Abby is led to believe that David beat one of his ex-girlfriends . And , understandably , this sets her off . You do n't get over something like that . She breaks up with David , who is shocked and hurt that she did n't even give him a chance . Because her past is a healed wound that still aches . <p> Additionally , Cyrus calls up Olivia for help with James . He tells her what happened , and Olivia tells him how to fix it . I found it really interesting that he sought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruthless , and Cyrus complies , because he is desperate . He invites James to the Oval office and puts on an act so convincing that there are tears . It is emotional manipulation at its best , because you can only manipulate those closest to you in that manner . Because you know exactly what buttons to push . And , as an audience member , I felt bad for James . While Cyrus is trying to protect pretty much everybody for Hollis , it 's still a shitty thing to do to your husband . It was absolutely CHILLING to see Cyrus snap right out of his emotional display as soon as James left the room . If he can act that well , I wonder what ELSE he hides . As he admitted last week , he is a monster . But damn , if he 's not a monster I 'd want on my side . ( And let 's face it : who , in this show , is n't some kind of monster ? ) <p> Huck eventually discovers the identity of the traitor spy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because Huck has changed . Or he 's trying to change . The girl he 's seeing ? Is affecting him for the better . But the soccer mom spy shoots the traitor , and in a silent , almost poetic scene -- they clean up . They are efficient and methodical . It 'd be beautiful , if it were n't so disturbing . <p> And , lastly , there 's Olivia , who is trying so hard to be normal . To live a normal life , with a man who fits into it . Edison shows up at her apartment , with all the making of a romantic in-home date . Alcohol , food , and movies . He is all smiles and charm . He keeps talking . Olivia 's silent , her face one step away from broken . She does n't say a word , and finally , he sees that she 's upset . It takes him entirely too long to notice . But he asks if she 's okay , and she still says NOTHING . She breaks down . They kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Edison Davis is on the other side of it . In that moment , Liv is broken . Her past , her choices , have swelled up to meet her -- and she is alone . She is missing her friend Steven , who would 've seen past all her defenses sooner . But the heart of the matter is that she misses Fitz . And it hurts in a way that is almost incomprehensible . It 's an inexplicable pain , that kind of separation . Sometimes , you just need to feel something . Sometimes , you ca n't fix what 's wrong , but you want to forget for a moment . You want to pretend to be normal . Olivia , when she ( presumably ) decides to sleep with Edison , it 's not about them as a couple . It 's about her and her pain . She 's trying to fix it . But what I think she 'll come to realize is this simple truth : you ca n't fix love . You ca n't handle love like other problems . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . And darling , normal is vastly overrated . <p> I will be watching a tv show , or talking on the phone , and then out of nowhere -- a scene guts me without mercy . A remark catches me perfectly off-guard . And I either crumble to pieces or fail to find actual words in any language . The other day , I was on the phone , and someone told me that somebody else ( who I do n't know personally ) has cancer -- in a manner very sensitive to what I 've been through , mind you . And I fumbled for any kind of sentence that sounded right , failed miserably , and just said , " Shit , I think I am actually speechless . " <p> And it caught me unaware , because I DO talk about my mom 's illness . I 've talked to friends whose other friends have cancer . I 've given advice . I 've offered a shoulder . So , I do n't exactly know why that particular instance knocked my verbal knees out from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and momentarily useless . <p> I do n't like that . I do n't like one of my favorite shows ( PARENTHOOD ) is like an emotional minefield , because one of the characters has cancer . And she 's getting chemo . And she wears button down clothing to chemo , for medically practical reasons . I find myself explaining how to true to life that is , and how my mother used to wear layers and button down clothing , fuzzy , soft sweaters especially . Because that 's what happens when you are pumping poison into your body . A means to an end , a hope that leaves you hurting . The truest kind of bravery I 've ever seen . But I digress .... <p> The most recent episode of that show totally gutted me . I realize that the smart , sane thing might be to NOT watch . In fact , after each new episode , I vow that I wo n't watch anymore . Turn away from the wreck . Read a book . Put music on . And yet , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . That is not the brave or the strong thing . Because all demons get stronger in the dark , when you turn your back . The monster always slinks closer when you blink . Our struggles , our hardships are weeping angels : when you blink , they make their move . <p> I think part of the problem is that I still want to be me . I still want to be the person people come to with their problems , even if the problem hits to close to home . I still want to watch the same shows I 've always loved and do the same things . Yes , there 's a gaping hole in my life . And no , there 's no Time Lord with a TARDIS to fix it . But that 's okay . That means there 's no Band-Aid covering a bullet hole . For a physical wound to heal properly , it heals from the outside in . For an emotional one , it 's the opposite . It 's easy to fool with a smile or a joke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside out . <p> Sometimes , I am softer than I expect myself to be . Sometimes , I do n't want to admit that . I do n't think they 'll ever be a time where I 'm unaffected by things . But I know that I 'm still me . I 'm still the person who wants to lend an ear . I do n't turn away from the things that hurt , because that does n't make the feeling go away . It just means I 'm too scared to face reality . <p> this religion is ours . there is no temple , no chalice , no holy book . we are what we worship , all fingers and skin , a kiss made of prayers , drunk on wine and each other , a covenant between bodies seeking salvation . <p> your hands are a psalm , and my hips are a rosary -- this dance a perfect call and response , a Sunday morning in the middle of a week , a letter from the gospel according to us . <p> my heart is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am to yours . At times , faith feels like a question , a favor asked to an empty sky , but we are our own resurrection again and again and again . <p> my prayers are never silent , my peace is never weak , and no matter the confession , the obsession , the candle lit in perfect dark -- we are what we worship . we are the love we seek . <p> There are parts of ourselves that we all wish we could hide , that we all try to hide . The less shiny , less perfect secrets , the shades of our reflection that we are afraid of . The things that we , sometimes , simply can not control . An instinct . An old habit . " Beowulf " was written to tell a story about the titular hero slaying a monster , Grendel . Years later , John Gardener wrote Grendel , a novel from the famed monster 's point of view . Why ? Why tell the villains ? Why humanize the creature that goes bump in the night ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruby in last night 's episode of Once Upon a Time ( Child of the Moon ) . Ruby 's story turns the tale of Little Red Riding Hood on its head . She is the wolf . She has no way to control her changes , except for a magical red cloak from her Granny . Of course , there was a time where she had no idea who she was . She killed people , including the love of her life , Peter . <p> With the landscape of magic shifting and changing in Storybrooke , Ruby ( Red ) has begun to regain some of her more wolfish qualities . A few weeks ago she admitted to having a heightened sense of smell and used it to locate the lost Belle . Once she realizes that she can not find her cloak , and it 's the first full moon since the curse was broken/magic was restored , Ruby locks herself in the freezer at Granny 's . <p> Decker , aka the Evil King who was Charming 's fake father in Fairytale Land , is hellbent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder she did n't commit , killing Billy ( who is actually GusGus from Cinderella ) . Ruby , realizing her worst fears have come true , has a truly poignant emotional meltdown , blaming herself for the harm she believes she 's inadvertently caused . Decker has whipped the townsfolk into an honest-to-fairies MOB -- complete with pitchforks and torches -- in an effort to make David/Charming 's life into a nightmare . ( More on nightmares in a minute . ) <p> However , in a Fairytale Land flashback , we find Snow and Red running away from the royal guard . Red 's cloak is torn , and she insists they split up for the night , for Snow 's sake . Red is discovered by a pack of wolves just like her , including the mother that she was led to believe in dead . Her mother has a bit of Crazy Eyes , but she teaches Red how to give in to the wolf , to be the wolf , so that she 's in control -- and does n't have any more blackouts . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a monster -- but as a lesson to us all , which is not to fight who we are . It is when we fear ourselves and are untrue to who we are that bad things happen . <p> Of course , Red 's mother thinks that humans are horrible and they are the monsters by default . When Snow stumbles upon their den , looking for Red , she is welcomed at first -- and then one of the palace guards kills a member of the pack . Crazy Eyes Mom goes full-on Lord of the Flies , decreeing that they must EAT Snow , including Red . Red , to protect her friend , fights her mother -- who dies and calls her a traitor to her kind . Talk about needing therapy there , Mommy Dearest . Red , beautifully played by Meghan Ory , says that she was n't betraying her family -- she was protecting it . This reminds us that family is n't always blood , and blood is n't always right . <p> Which brings us back to Storybrooke , where there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that she 's a monster who deserves to die , that she goes out to meet them as the wolf . Her friends ( David , Granny , and Belle ) believe in her . They see the good in her , when she is at her worst and can only see herself as a monster . Belle , in a wonderful quip , calls herself an ' expert on rehabilitation , ' which seems to imply her relationship with Gold has continued , though we have yet to see them interact for a while . Still : large cheer ! <p> Ruby , thinking of all her past mistakes , so easily blames herself . It is so easy to internalize guilt , thinking of our worst decisions , our worst failings . David tells the crowd ( who are one step away from shouting RUTABAGA ! which is a common shout in mob scenes ) the truth about Decker , who pretty much oozes vitriol and spite . He , taking a risk , walks toward Ruby with her rediscover cape , talking to her about seeing who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . David reminds Ruby of herself , and Ruby thus gains control over her own nature . That moment is very touching , because what person does n't need that kind of reminder , sometimes ? When we are down on ourselves , when we think we are the monster ? Everyone is Grendel , sometimes . But if we are lucky , there is someone to hold up a true mirror , instead of a distorted funhouse one . <p> Of course , not all 's well that ends well . Decker 's endgame was to destroy the Hatter 's hat , which he does with glee -- leading David to nearly shoot him . Ruby talks him down , but for a moment , I wished she had n't . Because Decker is an asshole . Where are his redeeming qualities ? We know from his backstory that his wife was barren . That he suffered . Each character in Once is layered -- even the Evil Queen has her roots and her reasons . I 'm curious about Decker 's . <p> We can not forget Henry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same nightmare , a side-effect of the Sleeping Curse . Regina , upon discovering that the nightmare has very real implications ( the dream flames burn Henry ) , she calls Gold . He can not stop the nightmares , but he gives Henry a necklace to wear that will allow him to control the dream , thus giving him a link to Fairytale Land through Sleeping Beauty . This is a pretty clever turn of events , and I 'm curious to see how it 's used to unravel and shape the storylines . Also , when Regina asks about the price for Gold 's services , he snarks that she could n't afford it , BUT since it 's for Henry , it 's on him . I wonder , then , if he 's truly acting benevolent -- or if he has some other kind of plan for Henry . Since we know that Henry can leave Storybrooke without a problem ( that IS how he fetched Emma ) , I wonder if he might bring Baelfire to Gold , assuming he can discover where his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show : no one is a hero or a monster ; everyone is both . David , with a gun in his hand , may nearly kill someone . Ruby , thinking the worst of herself , may attempt penance through sacrificing her own life . And yet , everyone is saved or redeemed . In the end , a person must choose to save him/herself -- to do the right thing . A friend can hold up a mirror . Someone who cares for you may stay by your side . But in the end , you have to choose to see the truth in your own reflection . In the end , you have to allow someone to be there for you . <p> In life , it often seems like perception is everything . The image of someone is more important than who they are , because that image is mistaken for who they are . Everything has a PR spin from the first time you sneak in your parents ' house at dawn to why , exactly , there 's a strange hair in your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messy . There is no truth that is truly pretty , truly polished . All the gleam in an illusion , a last line of defense . <p> In last night 's episode of Scandal , Olivia takes on a client who was Fitz 's competitor in the election . Initially , the story is he walked in on his wife being raped and shot the guy . As the episode progresses , it then comes out that she was having an affair with the man , a builder working on their house . Tearfully , the governor 's wife falls on her Roman sword , reflecting on how her husband changed after losing the election -- a election that was basically won by Olivia , because she knows how to set the perfect stage . She is , despite her love of truth , full of dirty little secrets . The governor lost that election , because she launched some kind of perception-based misdirect , proposing that the Governor was soft of guns . The irony now being , of course , that he SHOT a man with just such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame at Olivia 's feet for changing the course of their history , by getting Fitz elected . As the episode is so aptly titled , all roads lead to Fitz , after all . <p> The kicker is not the wife 's affair , or the fact that her husband became a different man after suffering the political loss that he did . It is that he knew his wife was having an affair . His murder was premeditated . In fact , he intended to kill his wife , her lover , and himself -- until , that is , she cried rape . ( A plot point which I kind of hate , because it complicates the idea of a rape victim -- which is a difficult enough position in this country . But that 's another story for another time . ) The governor , being a ruthlessly clever man , let his wife take the blame for a murder her intended to commit . Not only that , he used it to his political advantage . You see , the gun-happy governor is n't soft on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her couch to Cyrus ( who came to visit her , because he 's mad at his husband -- which is both hilarious and perfectly played ) , does n't it like it when the bad guy gets away . Neither does the audience . Cyrus ( the wonderful Jeff Perry ) quips that she should n't have come to DC . <p> As I said , perception is everything . Lest we forget the ominous meeting of the Five at the beginning of the episode , it appears that Olivia , Mellie , Cyrus , Hollis Doyle , and Senator Verna Thorton are involved in some kind of cover-up having to do with the whole Quinn Perkins debacle . In exchange for their help in that situation , everybody got something . The only stopping point at the moment is David ( Joshua Malina ) , who is seeking the truth like a rabid , crazy dog with a bone . They offer him a misdirect and his job back , unbeknownst to him at who is pulling the strings , and it almost worked -- until Abby discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems believing that Huck would be so careless as to leave that evidence on his computer screen . But , willing suspension of disbelief ... ( I also am not sure I buy that Abby would be working against Olivia , but we shall see . ) <p> One of my favorite parts of this episode , however , has to do with Cyrus and Mellie ( how amazing is Bellamy Young ? ) . You see , Mellie has gotten used to wearing the pants . She has gotten used to making demands , pushing Fitz around , and even circumventing proper channels and methods when it suits her . She does n't like having her hands dirty and she attempts to strong-arm Cy , who is just about to burst with rage , since his husband ( who wants a baby ) has come back to work as part of the White House Press Corp . Possibly the most awkward position to be in when one is the President 's Chief of Staff . Cyrus calls Mellie a " terrifying political animal , " before point out the menacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyrus is n't fooled by smoke and mirrors . He knows exactly who people are , where they stand , and what they are capable of . That is , perhaps , how he knew he needed Olivia on Fitz 's campaign all those years ago . I like the scene with Cyrus and Olivia , having wine on her couch . I like the idea of these two having a history and a friendship . And yet , given last season , I do n't trust Cyrus . I want to , but I do n't . Because the audience has seen him get his hands bloody , and not in a for the of others Huck kind of way . He is a monster , but he 's also the monster you want on YOUR side . <p> But speaking of Huck ( Guillermo Diaz ) , Huck as a date with a girl from his AA group . And honestly ? It is the most adorable thing I 've ever seen . He , too , is worried about perception and appearance . What should he wear ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lost gets . He takes her to a restaurant where neither of them can pronounce the food , and he does n't look at ease -- or like himself -- until he shows her what he likes to do for fun . Which is ... spy on people . But AA girl does n't seem daunted by this , and they kiss . And I awwww 'd . But one has to wonder : would she feel the same if she really saw Huck for who he is ? Not a recovering alcoholic , but a recovering assassin/murderer ? This is a ramped up quandary that happens in all relationships : will you still like me when my hair 's a mess , the makeup 's gone , and I 'm wearing an old tshirt ? When the glitz , glamour , smoke and mirrors are gone -- and I 'm just me ? One wonders . One hopes . Even , it seems , Huck . <p> Lastly , we 're going to talk about Olivia . Senator Edison Davis is pursuing her , hardcore . He even goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying no , but she 's not telling him to go away . Olivia claims she is n't ready to date , which leads us ( the audience ) to perceive that she 's genuinely interested in her ex-finacee . And yet , when Cyrus brings up the subject , Olivia freezes . She looks like she wants to crawl in her wine glass , because Olivia is broken . Olivia , I think , wants to seem like she 's moving on . Perhaps she wants that idea to snake its way back to the President . Because all roads lead to Fitz . That is perfect phrasing , by the way , because it has so many layers of meaning . Everything reflects on Fitz , since he 's attending the G8 conference . If someone in his circle does something to detract from his presence there , that also affects his image . For Olivia , though , even though she tries to walk away -- all roads lead back to Fitz , eventually . Because you ca n't walk away from your own heart . Fitz is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's where so many things began for Olivia : her heart , her career . So , she may be toying with the idea of Senator Davis ( even letting her employees/friends overhear ) , but it feels like a hollow charade . And maybe , just maybe , it 's not so much about Davis himself -- but about the attention . About feeling wanting . There 's a certain thrill in realizing that your ex , even after all these years , still carries one hell of a torch for you . And after a bad breakup , who does n't want to feel wanted ? <p> I 'm curious to see how it all plays out -- when the dirty secrets are revealed , what will the fallout be ? Rest assured , as the tagline says , dirty little secrets always come out . Maybe the secrets themselves do n't matter as much . Maybe the trick is that it 's all in the way they are presented . <p> We all try to do the right thing . The good thing . The decent thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wakes up in the morning PLANNING to be Hitler . I 'm pretty sure that 's something most sane , rational people look to avoid . Step one : Wake up . Step two : Do n't be evil . <p> And yet , what is evil ? What is wrong ? How , exactly , do you measure such a thing ? Too often we fail to acknowledge that goodness is a sliding scale and some things are relative . Villains do not wear black hats . The Good Guy is n't swathed in white . To quote Wilde , the pure and simple truth is rarely pure and never simple . <p> Imagine two people fall in love . Not a small , easy love . The ca n't eat , ca n't sleep kind of love . The consuming kind . The kind that fills you up like a light , struggling to find its way out . The kind of love that is impossible to ignore . These two people complement each other well . They bring out the best in each other . They lean on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect , right ? Now , imagine he is married . Imagine she was at one time his employee . This is less clear cut now , is n't it ? It 's less easy to parse out . Some people probably think : well , it 's just wrong . Forget the feelings , right ? Cling to the facts . <p> If you have n't caught on already , I 'm actually talking about Olivia ( a political fixer ) and Fitz ( the President ) from ABC 's Scandal . In the last episode , Fitz and Olivia broke up . Granted , they were n't even technically together . They were doing this awkward dance of love , this I love you , but I ca n't really have you THING . It 's not wrong or right . It 's layers , and those layers are confounding . <p> In the above scene , Fitz says that they 're done . And yet , it 's a soft statement , not a firm one . It 's followed by a question . That question is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the presence of it , is a very real plea . It means please tell me no . Please tell me I 'm wrong . Olivia , of course , agrees with him . He lets her go , but she does the same as well , by letting him walk away . But not putting up a fight . It is not a one-sided decision , but a mutual thing . <p> Interestingly , I 'm fairly certain that Olivia has never told Fitz I love you . He has said it -- to his Chief of Staff and to Olivia . But the closest she 's come is an I hate you , which was clearly a declaration of the opposite . Why does n't she say it ? Some might call that fear . Some might call it cowardice . I think it 's Olivia 's last wall . If she says that , that 's her last line of defense , gone . Because she may love this man who she should n't love , but nobody knows . And if she says it out loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because once you say that , you can not take it back . <p> So , these two ? Walk away from each other . Hands cleans , so to speak . Nothing else to say . And yet , I ca n't help but wonder about their decision . A breakup like that is never clean . It 's not an I do n't love you anymore departure . It 's not based on one person falling out of love -- or two people growing apart . It 's this situation is too complicated and/or we should n't do this . <p> And yet , as an audience , are n't we rooting for Olivia and Fitz ? Despite the situation , despite the hopeless of this insanely star-crossed love -- are n't we , every week , hoping that something will give ? We are waiting for those longing looks , that naked emotion , the passion that burns through time and space , honor and duty ? The love that transcends . They are a couple , even when they are apart . <p> Interesting , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mellie is always playing an angle . She has aspirations that move beyond being the FLOTUS . She is all image -- that is to say , everything is done with calculated precision . Their relationship does n't seem like it was always devoid of affection , but neither does it sing with even the hint of old love . This was a relationship of convenience . One that was good on paper . One that was n't invalid in the least -- but it is not a scorching look across a room . It is not something that keeps a person from sleeping . It is not an unguarded glance or the turn of a hotel key . <p> Which couple , objectively , would you root for ? Neither relationship is ideal . Both ache for different , disparate reasons . One is love , without a foundation . One is a foundation , without love . For me , I 've always been all about the underdog . I 've always been one to throw my lot in with the fools . I 've never been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily stays between the lines . I think that what Fitz did last week -- walking away -- was cowardly . It might 've been the right thing to do , if we 're talking textbook right and wrong . And yet , failing to honor one 's feelings is also wrong . It is also a disservice . There is no easy , simple answer . Olivia let him leave . She did n't put up a fight . She did n't run after him . She did n't even protest . But she did , after he left , break down . Both characters did the right thing , for the right reasons , but it still felt wrong . <p> That 's good TV . That 's brilliant acting . That 's a realistic portrayal of something between the lines . And damn , man , if that does n't pull at your heartstrings . <p> these moments are blind with ice , stuck to the panes of windows in a broken house , slivers of secrets trailing between doorways , echoing fights that have followed us for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not remember loving you , but I can count the ways I have lost you over time , again and again reaching out to find that you are n't truly there , even when you are sleeping underneath the same moonlight . <p> How do such things happen ? Like madness lit from within , a light that threatens to burn everything to ground , to raze even the smallest endeavor that might mean we could be okay -- somewhere , in my heart , I know that okay is not enough . And yet here I am . And yet here I stay . Why ? <p> This winter grows , and I know that I no longer miss you , or even the idea of you ; I am tired of being alone in this frost-laden place , this house where no one truly belongs and no one dares enough to live . <p> I am stripped of all promises , my face blank as a ghost , haunting my skin , wearing the idea of someone else 's happiness . If I were braver , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would leave . But we are jailed to our history , each holding the key that belongs to the Other , ignoring the lock , a simple failing to recognize each other 's needs . <p> this is how it happened : our bed gone dull , resentment swaddled around my naked body like a sheet , a woman no longer , my mouth gone sharp as knives , a vessel for anger that blossomed in my burnt heart . <p> silence burst on the doorstep , cold words pouring out of frozen arguments , man and wife without memories , bodies like stones smoothed with every insult , every smile a new faade , a stopping place , a wedding cake made of wounds , a woman crying , a man dead with forgetting . <p> And then , her . A small beginning , a call , a gathering light flickering before an open a window , a fierce knowledge stripped down to the nerves of a terrible possibility -- her smile may falter , but she will not disappear . She is like furniture between us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed to madness . <p> Careful , do not linger too long away , careful not to wander after your own heart . She may love you right down to your marrow , her miracle smile might dare you to believe , offering you shades of a broken mirror long forgotten beneath the ice -- love like that is a blood promise , a thing that tends toward death and all its beautiful repercussions , seductive as a universe drafted out of a dangerous skin . <p> But it is my cold eye you always have to fear , I own you through and through and through -- do not think to look for mercy here . <h> Who Am I ? <p> No , I 'm not 24601 .

##109052 <p> ( CNN ) -- The sour back-and-forth between the dueling presidential campaigns continued Wednesday , as Republican Mitt Romney fired back at Democratic claims he was responsible for the shuttering of a steel plant , and President Barack Obama 's team stuck to their argument Romney was a glorified corporate raider in the 1990s . <p> The skirmish extends back to Monday , when Obama 's team spent under $100,000 to air a television ad in battleground states that saddled Romney with responsibility for the shuttering of a steel plant under management of Bain Capital , the private equity firm he founded in 1984 . <p> In a radio interview Wednesday , Romney called the claims " really off target , " pointing out he was no longer making decisions at Bain when the company , GST Steel , went bankrupt . <p> " They say ' Oh gosh , Gov . Romney at Bain Capital closed down a steel factory , ' " Romney said in an interview with Ed Morrissey posted on HotAir.com . " But the problem of course is the steel factory closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no longer there . So that is hardly something that is on my watch . " <p> GST Steel was acquired by Bain Capital in 1993 , when Romney was acting as the firm 's chief executive . The firm declared bankruptcy in 2001 , after Romney had ceased day-to-day oversight of Bain . <p> Democrats are eager to point out Romney was still listed as Bain 's CEO in 2001 , despite having left the company to head up the Salt Lake City Olympic organizing committee . Obama 's campaign also argues decisions Romney made as the head of Bain led to GST Steel 's downfall . <p> In a conference call Wednesday , Obama 's Deputy Campaign Manager Stephanie Cutter pointed to two other companies -- American Pad and Paper ( Ampad ) and Dade Behring -- that were acquired by Bain and later went bankrupt . <p> Like GST Steel , Ampad and Dade Behring both filed for bankruptcy after Romney had ceased day-to-day management of Bain . Cutter said the likely Republican presidential nominee made decisions during his time at Bain 's chief that led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in his investments . <p> " My understanding of the situation is that the deal that was cut with Ampad , and the structure of the management at Ampad , was done while Mitt Romney was at Bain Capital and he had a hand in it , " Cutter said . " He did take a leave of absence for the Olympics , but he was still listed as president and CEO of that company , and was still making money off that investment . " <p> In his radio interview Wednesday , Romney said Democrats were willfully ignoring the jobs he did create at Bain , choosing to focus only on jobs that were axed . <p> " They do n't mention a couple of other things , " Romney said . " One is that we were able to help create over 100,000 jobs . Secondly , on the president 's watch about 100,000 jobs were lost in the auto industry -- auto dealers and auto manufacturers -- so he is hardly one to point a finger . " <p> Romney also hit Obama for vilifying his role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from private equity executives . On Monday , the same day his campaign launched their Bain attack , Obama attended a fundraiser hosted by Tony James , the president of the Blackstone Group . <p> " As a matter of fact we have made investments together over our history , " Romney said of Blackstone , a New York-based financial services firm . " I have respect for them and for much of the work they do . And I think you have a president that is just misguided in his effort to try and divide Americans from one another . " <p> Cutter seemed to push back at that accusation in the conference call Wednesday , saying Democrats ' censure of Romney did n't equal an attack on private equity , but rather a questioning of the values " Romney acquired at Bain . <h> We recommend <h> From around the web <h> sound off ( 31 Responses ) <p> Maxx <p> Tykl , you obviously do n't understand what Bain Capital was up to in the 90 's . The majority of their purchases were not made to infuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had assets that could be extracted for Bain 's profit . They were n't trying to save anything , just make themselves a lot of money . Whenever a Bain owned company went out business , Bain made millions . Venture capitalists assume risk when they invest , Bain had very little risk . This is corporate raiding . <p> May 16 , 2012 06:50 pm at 6:50 pm <p> jocko <p> Is Mitt an anchor baby ? <p> May 16 , 2012 07:07 pm at 7:07 pm <p> Pete <p> Was n't it Bachmann , Perry and Gingrich that started the assault on Romney , during their recent campaign , not Pres.Obama.I stated on these other sites the incumbent was sitting back , taking notes and laughing at all the mud slinging going around.Now he knows who his challenger is and there 's no stopping him , and he wo n't stop with the I quit either.They 're saying the president is hypocrital himself getting campaign money from other venture investment firms , so why go after Romney.But its not ALL INVESTMENT CAPITALISTS , IT 'S JUST ONE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other investment CEOs are n't , just that Mormon moron Romney , thats why again ! So you see , after all the spins are gone , all the political innuendos are said , he 'll still be against the incumbent , running for the big house at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave in DC.He wo n't be able to face his wife , kids and Mormon followers again , but ya know what , he 'll have Bain and Bain will have that maniacal Mormon moron Romney , just two peas in a really funny looking pod , shaped like magical diapers ! ! ! Did n't that Joseph Smith guy wear them too , weirdos , just pathetic weirdos .. <p> May 16 , 2012 07:16 pm at 7:16 pm <p> Greo Newbold <p> Mitt is not a capitalist . He has never had a idea for a novel product , invented it , developed it , built it and sold it . <p> Mitt has applied long standing manipulations of money and capital to extort and extract profits for his PE investors . This is wholly different from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support . Mitt Romney is no Steve Jobs , Mark Zuckerberg , Bill Gates , etc . <p> Obama need only question Mitt during a debate about how Bain , under his leadership , extracted profits for THEMSELVES at the expense of WORKERS and TAXPAYERS by taking money out of so-called " overfunded " pension plans which are guaranteed by the US Government . This is a TRANSFER of WEALTH that should be exposed . Mitt Romney is no Henry Ford capitalist that should be romanticized . <p> May 16 , 2012 07:46 pm at 7:46 pm <p> Ken <p> Figure , Team Obama spends only $100 , 000 on an ad that states the facts and Karl Rove panics and blows $25 million on a negative ad this early in mid-May . What does that say about how worried Rove is about the last man(niquin) standing , aka , alexithymic Mitt ? <p> May 16 , 2012 07:46 pm at 7:46 pm <p> Suspicious Voter <p> My respect for CNN just went up immensely due to Ashleigh Banfield 's challenge to Ben LaBolt 's attack ad on Romney from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Romney . It is because she was pursuing the " truth " and " fairness " of it all . That is something that Glenn Beck , Rush Limbaugh , Michael Savage , and the crew all accuse " mainstream media " like CNN for NOT doing . Yet here she is doing it on CNN . Who cares " who " is right ? I want to know " what " is right , first . Then I can decide " who " is right . That was more than a shot in Obama 's press secretary 's eye , it was a shot in the eyes of Beck , Rush , Savage and all , that CNN does care , it 's just as " fair and balanced " as the alternative media . She should get a raise . I 'll be listening to CNN a lot more after hearing her . Equal time folks for equal understanding . Hat 's off to Ms. Banfield and CNN for having her on staff . That 's

This in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children would be kicked off their parents ' insurance plans , as they become young adults . It would also bring back a time when insurance companies would deny patients with pre-existing conditions , along with a wide range of other issues involving coverage . <p> The GOP also has distanced itself from immigrants , particularly Latinos , by championing English to become the national language , and supporting policies such as " self-deportation " and voter suppression laws , and opposing the DREAM Act . <p> They have , as well , added into their platform their complete opposition to a woman 's right to choose an abortion , even in cases of rape and incest . <p> Also , they have reaffirmed their stance on marriage as being between only one man and one woman , while at the same time denying same-sex couples marriage equality and benefits . <p> Finally , the GOP wants to end federal student loan programs , which college students deeply rely on to receive an education . In its place , the government would channel money to banks so that they could administer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more would be an enormous step backward for the country , and it would have negative repercussions on many different aspects of our society .

##113252 <p> How can a person recover if he or she wo n't even acknowledge being ill ? <p> How is recovery relevant for people who say there is nothing wrong with them ? <p> But what about people who wo n't accept any treatment , who deny they need any help ? How does recovery-oriented care apply to them ? <p> These questions -- and others like them -- are frequently posed by frustrated practitioners and distressed family members trying to assist people who appear not to want help . One concern , or assumption , about these questions is that they point to a key limitation of the recovery paradigm , implying recovery and recovery-oriented practices are only for people who readily acknowledge having a mental illness . After all , how can a person be " in recovery " if he or she has nothing to recover from ? One of the major differences between mental illnesses and other medical conditions is the issue of insight . People with diabetes know they have diabetes ; people with asthma know they have asthma , etc. , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or at least those with schizophrenia ) lack insight into having the illness . Therefore , they will not participate in the treatments needed to manage their conditions . Such perceptions lead some people to argue that coercion and involuntary treatments are necessary , at least for those who refuse any or all treatments . The lack of insight also poses a major challenge to person-centered care planning and recovery-oriented practice , if both presume the person will take responsibility for driving his or her own care and overall recovery process . Is not insight , therefore , required for recovery ? <p> While it may sound contradictory at this point , I intend to show in the following two sections not only that recovery-oriented practice is possible for people who appear to lack insight , but that it may also be precisely these people who most need recovery-oriented care . Presently , people who appear to lack insight in these ways either receive no treatment -- because they choose not to access care -- or receive treatment in ways that to varying degrees are against their will . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery-oriented practice , and therefore argue it is perhaps these people -- more than any others -- who are in dire need of the constructive and effective alternative offered by recovery-oriented practice . How this is possible will take some explanation , because the question of insight or acceptance is a complicated one with several different answers . <p> When Insight Is Lacking A first question for clarification is " insight into what ? " Is it necessary for a person to accept he or she has a serious mental illness that we describe as " schizophrenia " or " psychosis " in order to participate in and benefit from person-centered care ? Or is it enough that the person is aware and willing to acknowledge something has gone dreadfully wrong in his or her life and might benefit from assistance trying to set things right ? Many of those who either do not believe or choose not to disclose having a mental illness to others for a variety of reasons , including the fact that many people continue to associate mental illnesses with serial killers , axe murderers , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not measure up to what they had wished for . If they concede their lives could be improved in some small way , there is room and opportunity for person-centered care . ( As long , of course , as this care does not require the person to accept or acknowledge beliefs about him or herself that he or she denies ) . In other words , we can offer different forms of help , including medications , to people who do not accept or acknowledge having a mental illness -- if that help does not come with too many strings attached and is viewed by the person as useful in his or her efforts to have a better life . As an example , a person who acknowledges staying up all night but denies auditory hallucinations are keeping her up , may still agree to try a medication that could help her get a good night 's sleep ( even if the mechanism by which the medication works is to quiet the voices ) . <p> A second clarification is to consider if the issue of insight is present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering from depression may be too depressed to recognize they are depressed ; people experiencing an acute manic episode may be too manic to recognize they are manic ; and people in an acute episode of schizophrenia may be too disorganized , paranoid , or absorbed in hallucinations and delusions to step back and recognize they are acutely symptomatic . This unawareness may no longer hold true , however , after the acute episode . Even in the case of schizophrenia , an illness for which the lack of insight has been proposed for more than a century as a pathognomonic sign , I have yet to meet someone with the condition who was unaware that something had gone dreadfully wrong in his or her life . The person 's account of what went awry may differ significantly from ours , but he or she is nonetheless painfully aware there is a significant problem and , more importantly , that others ' help could be beneficial , should these others be trustworthy people who have proven to have the person 's interests at heart . As long as the person is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery-oriented care remain possible . <p> But why do so many people with serious mental illnesses appear not to have insight ? This may be because they are in the throes of an acute episode . It may be because they are being encountered within a clinical setting where they feel scrutinized or devalued , and where acknowledgement of their problems would be perceived as a concession that could things worse . If you are stopped by the police for speeding , for example , you would not want them to know you did n't have your seatbelt fastened ( a personal story , and an extra $37 ticket ) , or worse yet , that you have cocaine stashed in your glove compartment ( not a personal story ) . They may appear not to have insight because no one has had or taken the time to earn their trust and provide a context within which they could feel comfortable sharing their most intimate and painful secrets . Put more simply , they may appear not to have insight because their personal explanation of their predicament differs significantly from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a common problem that it deserves a few paragraphs of its own . <p> After all , if lack of awareness of the illness is not an essential characteristic of schizophrenia ( it has yet to be accepted as such after a century of debate ) , why is it so difficult for people with the condition to accept they have it ? It is interesting to note that during the era in which lack of insight was first identified in schizophrenia , people were never told they had schizophrenia , or any other mental illness for that matter . As recently as 25 years ago , it was still considered taboo to inform people with serious mental illnesses that this was what we thought they had and what was causing their problems . If we did not view people with mental illnesses as capable of digesting and using such information , and therefore did not educate them , how could we expect them to " accept " their diagnoses ? <p> Even if we did educate people in school and in the general public about the nature of serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do -- it is far from a straightforward matter . The picture of what constitutes " schizophrenia , " for example , has only become more complicated since the term was first introduced by Bleuler at the beginning of the 20th century . As deliberations continue for the drafting of DSM-5 , many scientists are arguing there is simply no unitary condition we can call " schizophrenia . " There may be a group of loosely related conditions we might call " the schizophrenias " ( as Bleuler had originally thought ) , or there may be independent conditions we have mistakenly lumped together because of a Wittgensteinian " family resemblance , " with the now well-established heterogeneity in course and outcome due to the fact that these are actually different conditions . Finally , the psychiatric community in Japan has decided to do away with the term schizophrenia altogether , having found it stigmatizes and compounds complexities associated with diagnosing serious mental illnesses . If , after a century of dedicated clinical investigation , the field of psychiatry can not agree on what constitutes the condition we have described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so skeptical and unwilling to accept the diagnosis , especially when we have insisted for so long on designating them as " schizophrenics " rather than people experiencing a condition we call schizophrenia ? <p> As the consumer movement has now made abundantly clear , no one should be expected to accept being " a schizophrenic . " This is simply not the same as being " a diabetic " or " an asthmatic , " given the history of the term and the associated stigma . Providers who attempt to offer person-centered care to people they view as " schizophrenics " will be doomed from the start , not because of the deficits imposed by the illness , but because of their failure to respect the people they serve . In our experience , accepting diagnoses such as psychosis , schizophrenia , and bipolar disorder is not a prerequisite for participating in person-centered care . The only prerequisites for participating in this type of care are the desire to improve one 's life and the willingness to determine whether other people can play a useful role assisting the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions are in place , we can enter into productive discussions about how to make the person 's life better and what each party can contribute . <p> But how can you have such discussions without using the same diagnostic terms these people reject ? How can you develop a person-centered care plan for a person with schizophrenia without basing the plan on the fact that the person has schizophrenia ? This central question cuts to the core of what is new and exciting about recovery-oriented practice . Many practitioners will begrudgingly acknowledge that diagnostic labels are used mostly for the benefit of insurance companies or Medicaid/Medicare to justify reimbursement . While this is an oversimplification , i.e. , there are other legitimate uses for making as accurate a diagnosis as possible ( given the current state of our science ) , this common complaint suggests diagnoses are not all that helpful in formulating care plans on an everyday , " real world " basis . What is more important for the care-planning process -- and , as it turns out , what is more important to the person him or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder impact the person 's day-to-day life and make life more difficult than it would be otherwise ( all other things being equal ) . Person-centered care plans are based on the person 's aspirations and life goals and the ways in which pursuing these goals and aspirations have become difficult -- not on his or her diagnosis . <p> This is not to suggest we ignore the mental illness or pretend it is not actively disrupting the person 's life . Rather , those elements of a person 's experience caused by serious mental illness can be framed as barriers or obstacles the person faces pursuing his or her goals , or simply things that interfere with the person having the kind of life he or she wants . While it may seem to make little sense to describe the mental health condition of schizophrenia as a " barrier , " in the person 's experience aspects of the illness that are distressing and/or disruptive are more important and more pressing for attention than any particular diagnostic label or the etiological explanation that a diagnosis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices/having paranoid thoughts because you have a condition we call schizophrenia . " We suggest it is this mismatch between people 's lived experiences of the condition and our current diagnostic labels that accounts for a significant degree of the problem of insight with which we began . <p> Consider medical examples such as the fever that accompanies an infection or the flu . We know when we feel hotter than usual and have learned over time that a fever might indicate any number of medical conditions . When a doctor or nurse tells us we have a fever , we are therefore not usually surprised and have come to expect that various courses of treatment might be tried depending on the fever 's cause . If a bacterial source is suspected , we are prescribed antibiotics and may be told the medication could be ineffective if the cause turns out to be viral . Either way , we are told to expect the fever will go away in a few days and , if it does not , to contact the health care provider again . <p> Now consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person has such an episode , he or she is not likely to know that it is in fact psychosis . For most people , the initial experiences of hallucinations , delusional beliefs , and difficulties in thinking do not resemble other medical symptoms , and typically there has been little in the person 's family or educational background that could prepare him or her to identify these experiences as symptoms ( i.e. , unless a close relative has had a mental illness ) . In addition , these experiences are usually quite compelling and difficult to ignore , at times even arguing for a certain explanation of their presence ( e.g. , voices telling the person he or she is involved in a CIA thought experiment ) . Such compelling and distressing experiences do not go away when the person is told they stem from an underlying mental illness . Unfortunately , there has been little more offered by way of explanation to persuade the person that the diagnosis accounts for these experiences . <p> When pushed , practitioners have resorted to explanations such as " you have a chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an over/under-sensitivity to dopamine , " or " your brain is playing tricks on you . " But there is little in such an explanation that helps a person understand why the voices are addressing him personally ; why the voices know so much about him and his concerns ; why the voices are so harsh , critical , or disruptive ; why he can no longer carry on a coherent conversation ; or why he feels so unsafe that it seems the pope or the mafia ( or whomever ) is trying to hurt him . Why , if my neurons are firing so haphazardly or misfiring accidentally , do these experiences suggest a very different , very non-haphazard story ? Psychosis is no more unstructured or chaotic than dreams . Diagnostic categories like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder come across as relatively abstract and empty concepts in attempting to account for what are very real and compelling experiences . <p> As a result , it is often more effective when talking with people who do not simply accept having a mental illness to focus on the aspects of the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that level . For example , it is possible to say to someone , " It seems like you are being harassed by voices and feel unsafe a lot of the time , " without taking the extra step of concluding " and those experiences are part of a serious mental illness called schizophrenia . " It is possible to stop after commenting on how unsafe the person feels and ask , " How do you think I can be of help to you ? " , " What might help you feel safer ? " , or " What has helped you feel safer when you 've had these kinds of experiences before ? " And it is possible to suggest medications or other interventions that might be helpful in addressing these anomalous experiences without necessarily labeling them as " psychotic . " It is possible , for example , to say you have known other people with similar experiences , and some things they found helpful were certain medications and coping strategies ( e.g. , negotiating with voices ) . In other words , it may be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as possible and bring new information into that frame that might be useful in addressing the person 's immediate and pressing concerns , rather than asking him or her to take a leap of faith to believe in the utility of a diagnostic label that remains far from his or her experience base . <p> Once again , it is important to note this does not require the practitioner to ignore or downplay the illness , much less pretend the person is not ill . Rather , we are suggesting a strategy for connecting to and engaging a person in a potentially helpful ( and even healing ) relationship based on the person 's understanding of his or her predicament -- what psychotherapists and outreach workers have described as meeting the person where he or she is at rather than requiring the person to meet us on our terms ( and often turf ) . As a fundamental principle of recovery-oriented practice , this strategy is perhaps most needed by people who have not found a traditional biomedical explanation of their experiences to be either helpful or palatable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he or she is at might need to be taken both literally and metaphorically . That is , as many such people refuse to attend appointments at clinics or mental health centers , and often will have little to do with practitioners who identify themselves as mental health staff , connecting to them can require concerted and consistent outreach beyond the walls of conventional mental health settings . <p> Conducting this kind of outreach to engage people in trusting relationships may also be one of these practice areas for which peer staff may be especially , if not uniquely , qualified . Who better to connect to someone hearing distressing voices than a person who has heard them him or herself ? Who better to engage someone who is untrusting than an individual who has also felt unsafe ? Who better to translate medical and psychiatric knowledge into the language of everyday experience , to build bridges between the mental health frame of reference and the person 's frame of reference , than someone who has experienced both ? Meeting People ' Where They Are At ' Other than offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to people who do not accept or acknowledge having a mental illness ? First , by not insisting on acceptance or acknowledgment of having a mental illness as a precondition to providing concrete and practical assistance with their concerns . Second , by finding out what those everyday concerns and needs are ( by meeting the person where he or she is at ) and offering concrete and practical assistance to address those concerns and meet those needs . ( The Housing First model developed by Tsemberis and colleagues provides an excellent example of how highly effective such an approach can be for engaging and supporting people with mental illnesses , without setting preconditions on the help offered . ) Third , by taking a strength-based ( as opposed to an illness-based ) approach to addressing the identified concerns and needs . And fourth , both for the person in need and the practitioner 's sake , it is important to understand the engagement process will likely take time before producing tangible results . <p> If a person has been living with an unacknowledged and untreated serious mental illness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have developed some sense of reality that provides at least some sense of order in his or her life and some degree of protection against external threats , such as those posed by the police , intrusive mental health staff , and caring family members . If it has taken months or even years to build up such a structure , it is likely to take months or years for the person to begin questioning or putting this structure aside , even temporarily , to allow another person in . Keeping a sense of perspective in terms of the longitudinal course of the condition over the person 's lifetime is essential to persisting in the efforts described below . <p> There will be times , for example , when people will insist they do not need help of any kind and have no concerns or needs for which another person 's assistance or support is required . They are just fine , thank you very much , and have no need for your services , no matter how those services are described or offered . Prior to throwing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative routes to engagement . A key question in this instance , as it often is within the framework of recovery-oriented practice , is how is this person spending his or her time ? In the spirit of meeting the person where he or she is at , it is important to consider this question from the person 's perspective rather than ( or at least in addition to ) the practitioner or family member 's perspective . That is , while it may appear to you or the person 's loved ones that all he or she is doing is watching television or sleeping and smoking cigarettes , the person is likely to have a different perspective . And often it is the person 's perspective , rather than the concern the person is doing nothing , that offers the point of departure for engagement . Seldom , if ever , is a person doing absolutely nothing . If the person appears to be doing absolutely nothing and does not offer an alternative account of how he or she is spending the day , then consider Pat Deegan 's eloquent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind such appearances : <p> The professionals called it apathy and lack of motivation . They blamed it on our illness . But they do n't understand that giving up is a highly motivated and goal-directed behavior . For us , giving up was a way of surviving . Giving up , refusing to hope , not trying , not caring : all of these were ways of trying to protect the last fragile traces of our spirit and our selfhood from undergoing another crushing ( Deegan , 1994 ) . <p> How can we use any information the person is willing to provide about his or her time , while being careful not to represent the latest " crushing " in that person 's life ? The first two answers to this question reflect basic premises of recovery-oriented practice : 1 ) in the absence of information to the contrary , assume the person wants the same kind of things out of life as everyone else , and 2 ) build on strengths . <p> Take , for example , the story of Hank , a 47-year-old man diagnosed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board and care home and both the staff and his sister complained to the mental health clinic where he received medication management services that he had nothing to do with his time except smoke cigarettes in the yard . This had become a pressing problem for the board and care home and Hank 's sister because he was harassing other residents for cigarettes and pestering her for additional money . He insisted there was nothing else for him to do during the day and did not see his behavior was problematic for others . However , if the situation was left unaddressed , he was at risk of being thrown out of the board and care home where he was living . Hank 's sister was already worried about finding another place for him . Being somewhat gregarious , however , Hank was quite willing to talk to an outreach worker , especially when he learned she was a young female . Over the next several weeks , the outreach worker visited Hank at the board and care home and explored his interests . When asked if he was interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need the money because he had cut a number-one hit record and his royalty check was due any day . Once the check arrived , he would pay the other residents and his sister back for all the cigarettes and money he had borrowed and thereafter live on " Easy Street . " <p> It was n't until sometime into the second month of her visits that the outreach worker stumbled upon another of Hank 's interests . When asked about the things he used to do for fun , Hank said he had a longstanding interest in cars . As a teenager , when other boys his age were getting learners ' permits and dreaming of their own cars , Hank was busy building models of antique and sports cars . Shortly after this discussion , the outreach worker asked Hank if he would like to build model cars again , for old times ' sake . Hank liked the idea , but bemoaned not having the money to buy the kits right then , since his check had yet to come and he did n't even have enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hank 's permission , the outreach worker contacted his sister , who was more than happy to provide him with a gift card to a local hobby and craft store as an early birthday present . The outreach worker and Hank visited the store together , and Hank selected a couple of models , glue , and other supplies he would need . <p> Several months later , the outreach worker was happy to see the models completed and displayed proudly in Hank 's room , and surprised to learn he had secured a part-time job at an auto mechanic shop down the road . With his interest in cars piqued , Hank had begun taking 10-minute walks to the auto shop to look at cars and chat with the mechanics . After several weeks , the owner offered to pay him to wash and dry cars he had repaired so they would look nice for their owners . Hank started working about 8 hours a week for minimum wage , which provided a little disposable income on top of his disability allowance . Just as importantly , it gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At this point , the outreach worker decided not to ask Hank about his change of heart in terms of work , satisfied to notice he no longer mentioned his number-one hit record or imminent royalty check . <p> Felicia 's story offers another example . While Hank had been willing to take antipsychotic medication and visit the clinic every few months , Felicia adamantly and consistently refused all mental health services . She lived with her parents , who were increasingly concerned about her refusal of any assistance or support , and saw her becoming more absorbed in a world of hallucinated voices and paranoid and delusional beliefs . In particular , Felicia 's parents were very concerned about the walks she would take in the middle of the night when she could n't sleep , often slipping out of the house between 2 and 4 a.m. to wander around town in the dark . Felicia would not listen to their protestations or concerns . She dismissed the thought she might be robbed or raped , and stubbornly insisted she had the right to be out at any hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to walk outside at those early hours for her health , her parents could not reconcile her paranoid thoughts with her apparent willingness to put herself at risk for victimization . What they did not know until much later was the voices Felicia had been hearing at night insisted she leave or else death and destruction would be brought upon the house , killing her and her parents . From this perspective , it became apparent Felicia 's nighttime walks were driven both by her fear of the voices and her courage and determination to save her parents from the hell she was experiencing . <p> Felicia 's parents became very frustrated with the local mental health agency 's consistent response that there was nothing they could do to intervene unless she posed a serious risk to herself or others , or became so gravely disabled that she was not able to take care of herself . According to the agency 's staff , the risks posed by her late-night walks were not considered serious or imminent enough to justify coercive or involuntary measures . <p> Not knowing where else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alliance on Mental Illness chapter meeting , where they learned of a nearby peer-operated drop-in center that might offer them some hope . They visited the center and explained their situation to the peer staff . At first , the staff echoed the response of the mental health agency , informing them there was nothing they could do if Felicia was not willing to come to the center of her own accord . Rather than citing State statutes regarding risk , their reasoning was that drop-in centers were strictly voluntary programs and they thought it was important to respect Felicia 's wishes and autonomy . They would not be comfortable doing anything she had not agreed to beforehand , including visiting Felicia at her home as her parents had requested . Not to be swayed in the face of even the most formidable obstacles , Felicia 's parents asked if they could speak to someone at the center who might be particularly sympathetic about their situation . Was n't there anyone , either staff or a member , who had once been in Felicia 's shoes and could offer some useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request and promised to call them if they found someone who fit their description . Several days later , Felicia 's increasingly skeptical and concerned parents were relieved to get a call from the drop-in center . They had presented the request at a staff meeting , where a staff member had agreed to talk further with Felicia 's parents about her previous experiences . She called them and explained she had also been very reluctant to accept mental health services , or any help for that matter , in the early course of her mental illness , and understood their concerns and frustration . While she felt it was important to respect Felicia 's wishes , she was happy to visit them to discuss the situation and meet Felicia if she was willing . Several days later , the staff member visited Felicia 's home to meet with her parents . She told them her story of recovery and how difficult it had been for her and her family to struggle through the darkest and scariest days . She encouraged Felicia 's family not to give up hope and continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior . Although she had not personally taken the risks associated with Felicia 's late-night walks , she had experienced significant difficulty sleeping through the night -- a problem she still struggled with . She was also often awake between 2 and 4 a.m. , but had found ways to manage this disruption without putting herself in a risky situation . At that point , Felicia 's father jokingly suggested the staff member could talk with Felicia at 3 a.m. , since they were both awake at that time and had little else to do . <p> The staff member laughed politely at the suggestion , but then paused and wondered aloud , " Why not ? " As it turned out , she worked the night shift at the respite program operated by the drop-in center and was happy to talk with Felicia at 3 a.m. -- once again , if Felicia was interested . Excited by the idea , Felicia 's mother called up to her bedroom and asked if she would be interested in meeting another " night owl . " Curious about what her mother meant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced herself as another person who was often awake between 2 and 4 a.m. , and who would be happy to have some company during that time . At first disbelieving , Felicia was about to return to her bedroom when the staff member offered a piece of paper with two phone numbers . " If you do n't believe me , " she said , " call either or both of those numbers any night you want and see if I 'm up , too . Chances are I will be . " <p> To which Felicia responded , " But why are there two numbers ? " <p> " Oh , " the staff member replied . " The second number is my home number , but several nights a week I work the night shift at a respite program and that 's the first number . I figured if I was going to be up anyway , I might as well get paid for it . " <p> A week or so went by before anything happened , but soon after , Felicia called the first number on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member answered the phone and seemed genuinely glad she had finally called . Over a series of months , a trusting relationship gradually developed between the two . The first indication of any real " progress " from Felicia 's parents ' point of view came about 6 months into the process , when Felicia agreed to take a self-defense class with the staff member at a local YWCA . As they progressed through the class together , Felicia 's self-confidence began to grow , and their late-night conversations deepened . Felicia finally explained why she had difficulty sleeping through the night and what the voices were saying when they threatened her . Much to her surprise , the staff member did not find the explanation strange , nor did she view Felicia as " crazy , " as many of her former female friends from high school had . Instead , she seemed familiar with the experience of hearing voices and actually had some useful strategies to make the voices less distressing . She also suggested Felicia stop by the drop-in center during the day , when other people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felicia was intrigued by this idea and agreed to stop by on a day the staff member could introduce her . <p> After hearing from several members of the drop-in center that certain medications might also help decrease or control the voices , Felicia decided to make an appointment with her primary care doctor . After she made it perfectly clear she had no interest in visiting the local mental health center to see a psychiatrist , her doctor prescribed a low-dose antipsychotic medicine to see if she would benefit . It took several visits over several months to find the right medication at the right dose , but Felicia eventually experienced significant relief from the voices and paranoid ideas and became a regular member of the drop-in center . Where she will go from here has yet to be determined , by her . <p> As these examples suggest , cultivating a trusting relationship within which the person may eventually begin to divulge his or her concerns and become willing to accept support takes time and persistence . For some people , however , there may be no way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to take the time required . <p> Conclusion Until now , it has primarily been staff on outreach or assertive community treatment teams who have had to learn how to " observe the proper rites " in " establishing ties " with people who have refused mental health care . As the behavioral health field moves more firmly and deeply into the territory of recovery-oriented practice and we strive to meet our patients or clients where they are at , the lessons these staff have learned will become relevant and useful for staff in a variety of settings , so clients can benefit from the full range of services and supports we have to offer . <p> We welcome your views , comments , suggestions , and inquiries .

" I do n't think the common person is getting it , " she said from the passenger seat of a Range Rover stamped with East Hampton beach permits . " Nobody understands why Obama is hurting them . <p> " We 've got the message , " she added . " But my college kid , the baby sitters , the nails ladies -- everybody who 's got the right to vote -- they do n't understand what 's going on .

" <p> The Zambrellis scoffed at attempts by the Democrats -- who mocked Romney in an ad Sunday as " great for oil billionaires , bad for the middle class " -- to wage class warfare . " Would you like to hear about the fundraisers I went to for him ? " Sharon Zambrelli said of Obama . " Do you have an hour ? ... All the ones in the city -- it was all of Wall Street . " <p> " It 's not helping the economy to pit the people who are the engine of the economy against the people who rely on that engine , " Michael Zambrelli said as the couple waited in their SUV for clearance into the Creeks shortly after the candidate 's motorcade flew by and entered the pine-tree lined estate . " He 's basically been biting the hand that fed him in ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here were supporters of Obama in ' 08 . And they 're here now . " <p> I wonder honestly how the Zambrellis have been doing in the last 4 years , because they seem to be saying that 90%+ growth going to people like them is unacceptably low and Obama needs to go because of it . Loosely translated , I 'm seeing " Well McCain/Palin were basically insane and we were n't going to help them , but this Obama guy actually is talking about making us pay more here . Who does he think he is ? " <p> And we 're all really just ungrateful , stupid bastards to these people , and they really do n't understand why more of us are n't eager to worship them as the " engines of the economy " when the reality is our consumer-based economy has been driven by the middle class buying crap at a breakneck pace and putting money in the pockets of these people , and as far as they 're concerned they just do n't need us anymore . Hey , to an extent they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and India and Brazil and whatnot who will buy their corporate crap these days . We 've made ourselves obsolete in the grand corporate crap consumption game . It 's gone global . <p> If we understood anything , we 'd understand that they can make our lives even more miserable and they 've signaled their intent to do just that . Of course , if we really understood things , we 'd be out there making things extremely miserable for the gilded class while we still could . It has n't occurred to any of them that the rest of us are in trouble , and do n't see why we ca n't be like them if we just played our cards right . Pretty easy to make a royal flush or three with 47 cards in your hand , of course .

For a lot of these people the American Revolution ensured their right to be obscenely and unintelligently wealthy , and the French Revolution proved that if you behead too many rich people , Europe declares war on you . <p> What 's the name of that **25;2291;TOOLONG where the Stupid(s) think they 're smarter than everyone else , and have no idea how Truly Fucking Stupid They Really Are ? Because these dimwits are prime examples thereof . <p> There 's the whole illusion that the increase in size of Wall Street financial ' industries ' is economic growth in any sense . It 's clear , in fact , that Wall Street grows by imposing taxes and rents on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the proceeds -- with odds that turn out to be fixed . This works nicely , except when it does n't and the whole economy jumps the shark . Then our tax dollars are spent to rescue the various ' to big to fail ' institutions . Gives a whole new meaning to ' moral hazard ' . <p> OMG , the hubris here is so thick , you could cut it with a guillotine : <p> " It 's not helping the economy to pit the people who are the engine of the economy against the people who rely on that engine " <p> I really wonder to what business Mr. &; Mrs. Zambrelli owe their ( implied ) affluence : if it 's " Wall Street " , as she seems to imply , the arrogance and shortsightedness of casting it ( and , them ? ? ) as the " engine of the economy " is near-pathological . The FIRE sector is n't the " engine " of the nation 's economy , it 's the fuel system . Which , in the last decade or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the affluent assclowns gathering at the Hamptons Romney meetup . <p> heading out to the Sandbox and hoping most of you comes back in useable condition . <p> This is n't even a guarantee anymore . If you do n't retire , you 're back to square one , unless you had a job in the military that gave you time to go to school . It 's doable in combat arms , but very difficult . Even the " job traiing " is n't so much . If you did retire , you get that paycheck , but it 's not a " retirment " anymore ; it 's your mortgage/rent/utilities and you still have to start a new career . And that healthcare for life ? Not anymore . Once you hit a certain age , you have to pay for Tricare Prime . <p> It 's still the best retirement deal out there , but now that I 'm on the outside , I can see just how shitty it is compared to what you have to do . <p> I wonder honestly how the Zambrellis have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be saying that 90%+ growth going to people like them is unacceptably low and Obama needs to go because of it . <p> What it sounds like to me , is that people like the Zambrellis bought into a variation of Limbaugh 's " magic negro " bullshit . As though this was some kind of new experiment that made them feel like cool kids doing something progressive by voting for Obama and the first black nominee for president . <p> After he won , then the reality set in that Obama is a politician just like all the others ( albeit a very good one , imo ) , that do political things as president . And that beyond being imperfect to begin with , had to work within a system as one of three actors in our governing system , with no special powers beyond those limited by his office . And with plenty of new prez errors that all new presidents make , before they get their sea legs . <p> So their minds shut down , and old stereotypes took them over , and any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fair judgement , that can only be fair if compared to other presidents before him , and not some conjured ideal . And it just flew right by them , all that anti King stuff the founders made our constitution with . <p> So Obama , in the minds of these people had only two ways to go -- perfection , or being black in their White House . We 've had more than our share of these types , right here on this blog . The good news is , these type of OBama voters seem to be a distinct minority from 2008 , as most have pretty much stuck with the Kenyan Usurper through thick and thin , as per polling the past 4 years . <p> @ Peregrinus : I think the French Revolution proved that political infighting and purity purges of your own allies leads to an unworkable government and a military dictatorship . Thomas Paine was arrested and slotted for execution by the Revolution . The Terror really was n't just about chopping the heads off of rich people . It was more like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich people might be something we 'd like to try in 21st century America . Give it a whirl , gents , give it a whirl . <p> I use it like Friedman 's cab driver , but over the weekend I dunked my head in the anything goes forum of a travel-related board I frequent , and there was a thread on " would you pay more for American-made products ? " Responses were about ten-to-one against . What got me was the rationale that most of those clowns offered : that American manufacturing workers have been overpaid ( unspoken was that it was probably because of fat union contracts ) since , well , forever , and that , if they could n't compete at what the " market " was willing to pay ( i.e. Chinese slave labor ) , that was tough for them . <p> Most of the usual suspects in that forum are , broadly speaking , middle-class , white-collar , business-services workers or low-end managers ( not unlike yrs . trly . ) . The idea that their jobs depend , in large part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the businesses their employers serve is totally lost on them . Also too , that there 's nothing about their jobs protecting them from offshore Romnifying . Stockholm syndrome , game-set-match . <p> @ General Stuck : Agreed but I think they are concerned about the debt and entitlements . They do n't care if Social Security is raided and Medicare gone . They can pay for those things . They are more concerned that they will have to pay higher taxes . <p> Well , I just woke up about 3 minutes before writing my comment , without reading the whole post , so the Zambrellis are n't exactly where my comment was directed specifically , though generally they could fit into it . The part about voting for the black guy , that after he won , being disappointed from not doing things in the obedient way they wanted . And for them , that would be taking care of rich patrician type liberals . <p> I try to avoid countertop-inspecting , but after this came up last night I could n't resist Googling Michael Zambrelli , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + Partners . ( Not Zambrelli and Partners , Zambrelli plus Partners , because that 's way cooler . ) So he 's more like a car detailer to the engine of the economy rather than part of the engine itself . <p> This article has cleared something up for me . I have been wondering for a while how all of these people I work with who have been working for a government contractor can argue for lower taxes and rail against big government , and believe that it 's OK for the wealthy to pay less than the rest of us . The answer is this : Most of the people here have never had any job other than this one , and ultimately they know their job security is based on the kinds of ponzi schemes and backdoor handshaking that is done by the few at the top , no matter what kinds of official rules are in place . They have never really been in a situation where their jobs are threatened : These jobs require you to be a US citizen , so they ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they are operating in the free market , but they are as far away from it as they can possibly be . <p> I skipped right to the end of the comments and promise I will read them later on during a break . What I love to do when I read someone 's name or anything I am not familiar with is google it . Here is a snippet of what I found under the name Sharon Zambrelli -- " As occupancy rates at luxury hotels have grown 13 percent over the past five years , prices have risen by 19 percent , according to Smith Travel Research . ( That comes despite an 18.5 percent increase in the number of rooms over the same period . ) Higher prices can make for higher expectations . " People think because they have the money they should get whatever they want , " says Sharon Zambrelli , a New York beauty-industry consultant who had a run-in with another guest at the Breakers in Palm Beach , Fla. , last month when he refused to get off chairs her husband had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss it , Zambrelli got a pool attendant she knew , who helped her get the chairs back . " <p> You really really have to wonder exactly where she is in her thoughts . Makes my head hurt trying to figure her conflicts out . <p> " There 's plenty of people in China and India and Brazil and whatnot who will buy their corporate crap these days . " <p> That 's just it . The 1% do n't need us . The elite have destroyed labor unions by outsourcing and offshoring . They encourage high rates of immigration to keep ethnic tensions high and the working class voting Republican while simultaneously African-American political power is further and further diluted . But the basic underlying message globalization and immigration sends to every American is simple -- you 're nothing special , do n't make trouble or we will replace you . And the left has no answer . <p> One , because a person is " lower income " -- whatever she means by that , and probably 99% of most people are " lower income " than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's the one who needs some . Maybe with all that money , she could buy a conscience ? : ) <p> P.S. Information is not knowledge , and knowledge is not wisdom . She probably has no idea what that means . <p> " People think because they have the money they should get whatever they want , " says Sharon Zambrelli , a New York beauty-industry consultant who had a run-in with another guest at the Breakers in Palm Beach , Fla. , last month when he refused to get off chairs her husband had saved minutes earlier . When the other guest would n't discuss it , Zambrelli got a pool attendant she knew , who helped her get the chairs back . " <p> Imagine that , one of the common people helped her . I guess that 's why God made common people -- to help the job engines like Sharon Zambrelli be comfortable so she can sit around creating important jobs , like more beauty-industry consultants . <p> The Terror really was n't just about chopping the heads off of rich people . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . On the other hand , the French peasants did n't have a lot to lose . They already were possibly overworked and definitely underfed to the point where their numbers were shrinking . This was in an Europe that saw every other population expanding . And the urban lower classes were n't better off . To them , the Revolution was worth the risk . <p> Pursuit of ideological purity , though , can be a bitch . What is the Vulcan thing , " infinite variety " ? This is much more supportive of life . <p> @Peregrinus : I think the French Revolution proved that political infighting and purity purges of your own allies leads to an unworkable government and a military dictatorship . Thomas Paine was arrested and slotted for execution by the Revolution . The Terror really was n't just about chopping the heads off of rich people . It was more like a Stalinist purge . <p> Not the last revolution where such things had happened . I suspect that if you beat people down so long and so brutally as , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing , then by the time these people finally snap and revolt , they 've been radicalized enough that no one 's in the mood to listen to voices of restraint , and it 's fairly easy for the assholes to get the purges rolling . <p> " There 's plenty of people in China and India and Brazil and whatnot who will buy their corporate crap these days . " <p> Except that eventually the only thing left in the USA will be the management . And then these countries will wisely realize that they do not need foreign management running what is essentially a domestic company . India is already well on its way there . <p> She sounds like most " educated Democrats " , vote liberal because they agree with them on social issues but want Republican economic solutions along with ass kissing , and when they do n't get them will bolt the party . It 's also the type of modern " fiscal conservative , social liberal " centrist that seems to run the Democratic party . <p> Honestly I do n't think anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next time they land in the street they might be robbed or killed , their children might be kidnapped or shot , or that the mob might burn down their place in the Hamptons with them still in this is going to matter ... because it does n't . People only care about their money or their lives , in order to extract things from them they need to be convinced that both their money and their lives are in extreme danger . <p> Hey , to an extent they 're right . There 's plenty of people in China and India and Brazil and whatnot who will buy their corporate crap these days <p> Bullshit . The people in these countries are fighting to survive as much as anyone here , and they fight back as hard against corrupt oligarchies as hard as anyone here . And they deserve a better life as much as anyone here . <p> I understand your rage and note some of your well aimed barbs , but it 's a global economic struggle , not just an American one . <p> @ redshirt : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win " , but it would be bloody and violent and as brutal as any modern war or revolution in Africa . There are more of us and the RW would inevitably rise up against the gov't placing the majority of the military and it 's equipment on " our " side . But , no one wins in that manner . Maybe the rich would be brutalized ; probably actually . Maybe , we 'd weed out the crazy , RWingers and usher in a new age of liberalism and good will . But the generations involved would always know that we did n't win because our ideas were better ; we 'd win because there are more of us , they are cowards and would n't be able to live up to their own fantasies , and we had to brutally take it with local atrocities to match . <p> @ Cacti : In fact , give the CEO ' s a month off versus one day without baggage handlers . The real " producers " -- the people who actually make things and do stuff -- do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsensical strings of MBA buzzwords . In fact , let 's see how the 1% does if every nanny and housekeeper takes a few days off . <p> @ Cassidy : Gotchya . I have no idea how a CIVIL WAR 2 ! would go down . Large parts of the military are wingnuttified -- the Air Force , for example . There 's no clear demarcation lines such as the fabled Mason-Dixon line any longer . <p> I wonder honestly how the Zambrellis have been doing in the last 4 years , because they seem to be saying that 90%+ growth going to people like them is unacceptably low and Obama needs to go because of it . <p> I do n't get the rage against Zambrelli or anyone else , who does n't like Obama 's economic tone . <p> It 's human nature to view yourself has good at blank . <p> As long as you have some interest in it , it does n't matter what it is , whether it 's cooking , car repair , gardening , and most importantly your career , because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to invite trouble . <p> These folks are no different . <p> No one has that level of self awareness , where they take , accept or believe criticism about themselves willingly . <p> There are more of us and the RW would inevitably rise up against the gov't placing the majority of the military and it 's equipment on " our " side . <p> They 'd also have as much trouble as the old Confederacy securing international support . ( It 's a factor that often gets overlooked , but the Revolution would 've been hard to win without the French helping us , and the Civil War would 've been a lot easier to lose if they and the Brits had done the same for the Confederates ) . <p> A nice thick rope so there 's no beheading , a low drop so they slowly strangle just like they are slowly strangling us , and a big plastic bucket that 's easy to dump for the ' drippings ' . Piano wire is too messy and swift , the same with guillotines . Alternatively , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe a dozen at a time , and then using them to batter down the Koch mansion walls . <p> @ redshirt : To a certian extent you 're right : in the Officer Corp and among Senior NCO ' s there are a lot of conservatives ranging from Republican to RW whackjob . Under that , the younger crowd , there is a pretty heavy slant center to left . Of course , you got your backwoods boys , but they do n't outnumber the minorities . <p> But , yeah , anarchy is definitely right . I think the fighting would be confined state to state until one side or the other won . Would make an interesting novel . I wish I could write . <p> EAST HAMPTON , N.Y . -- A woman in a blue chiffon dress poked her head out of a black Range Rover here on Sunday afternoon and yelled to an aide to Mitt Romney , " Is there a V.I.P. entrance . We are V.I.P . " <p> As old and cynical as I am , it boggles one with disbelief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people . <p> The packed schedule of fund-raisers seemed to create some confusion among the guests . As he pulled up outside Mr. Perelman 's estate , Ms. Schwartz 's companion initially wondered if he was the home of the Koch brothers . Oh , he said , not yet . " We are going to all of them , " Ms. Schwartz explained . <p> I wonder how much they paid to attend those three fund raisers , and how much in taxes they 're hoping to avoid by voting for Romney . <p> Within a personal calculus , you are likely right as a matter of pure objectivity . But we are talking about politics as it intersects with class , not the personal . So your comparison of everyone is in the same boat , as far as their personal perceptions of where they fit on the socioeconomic scale , is irrelevant . <p> The facts are that for thirty years , policies of republicans has widened the wealth gap between rich and poor , that equates to a siege on the middle class , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a cold viewpoint in service to national survival as a vibrant and healthy democracy . <p> Rich people do n't get any credits whatsoever , for self defense or delusion , in a class war . They get verbal pitchforks to pay their fair share , and to invest in the middle class that has likely made them rich in the first place . And if they do n't want to do it themselves , then there are other ways . <p> I do n't get the rage against Zambrelli or anyone else , who does n't like Obama 's economic tone . It 's human nature to view yourself has good at blank . <p> Next time you drive down the street and see a " forclosure/for sale " sign ask yourself why people might be pissed that the Lords of the Universe are sociopathic morons actively destroying the fabric of American society . <p> If we lived in good times people like Zambrelli would be nothing . They 'd have their sheltered life of luxury and nobody would care . But we do n't , and so people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get ridiculed . They think they 're great ? Awesome , good for them . But they 're not , and their attitude is literally hurting us as a nation and , likely , individually . We 're not supposed to get angry at that ? <p> @ Brachiator : Still not sure where the hostility towards meis coming from . The fact that Brazil , China , India has a middle class that will buy things does n't make them the enemy and I never said that , it makes them the next targets to be fleeced by our one percent job creators . America 's middle class is no longer necessary . <p> A few cars back , Ted Conklin , the owner of the American Hotel in Sag Habor , N.Y. , long a favorite of the well-off and well-known in the Hamptons , could barely contain his displeasure with Mr. Obama . " He is a socialist . His idea is find a problem that does n't exist and get government to intervene , " Mr. Conklin said from inside a gold-colored Mercedes as his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . It 's a well understood principle ( amongst pillagers ) that it 's the defenders against an invasion that starts the war . The invaded people have the choice of surrendering or resisting . If they surrender there 's no war . So the defenders are always the one that start the War by resisting . <p> This is part of the philosophy of the House of the Dragon in Steven Brust 's Draegara novels . I find it ironic that a piece of military philosophy that was made up to illustrate how a group of people are different from humans serves as a perfect illustration of how the monetary elite of this country see the rest of us . Ironic and scary . <p> This makes me wonder what would happen if we all stopped our discretionary spending . Just flat-out stopped : no ice cream , no nail polish , no toys , etc . According to R 's donors , the economy would just keep humming along , no problem , because after all , it 's the 1% who are the engine of the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had read the full article , you 'd have known that the generous Mr. Simmons had opened up his Throat-Warbler Mangrove luxury yacht to a bunch of " Bowery bums . " ( Not to be confused with " The Bowery Boys " of course . ) <p> The left has no answer because the left does n't have the machinery to employ people . That seems to be the domain of the right , who treat employees as nothing more than slaves that they are required by stupid , communist laws to pay . <p> I just do n't think we should be surprised/shocked by their lack of self-awareness . <p> I 'm not . <p> I am often reminded of a situation Thomas Wolfe described , lo these many years ago : a woman , I believe it was his married lover , who lived on-or-about Park Avenue ( back when that meant a lot more than it does today ) with her husband , and who often complained ( inwardly or verbally ) about how poor they were , because many of their friends could afford better digs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ( figurative ) Hamptons , or whatever . The parallel today , of course , is that some of the 1% whine because the 0.1% have so much more than they do , so they ( the 1.0% ) are not REALLY rich . <p> This job engine that . Zambarelli talks about needs to be junked and replaced because it'sure misfiring and really not starting at all . Zambarelli owns an ad agency And is responsible for making chuckee cheese cool.You would think he would be helping Mitt Romney look cool . <p> So let 's review . The rich for the most part are being douchebags . Nothing new there . The oh so not rich are being shit upon . Nothing new there . The problem is not that the status quo needs to be changed or that the rich have money and the rest of us do n't . The problem is that we are the ones living through another patch of history where this is happening again and that the tipping point is still in the future . We wo n't know when that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form and we do n't know how much damage will happen to change the situation . What we do know is eventually change will happen , it will not be pretty , safe or easy . It may not be in my lifetime ( maybe 25-30yrs ) , it may be next week . Mainly it 's just no fucking consolation that we are repeating history , once again . <p> Finance does not directly create wealth . It is overhead . When the cost of moving money ( financial industry profit as a % of GDP ) into actually creating wealth by building a house or a car or producing food has increased from 16% to 40% as it has in this country , the financial industry has taken a large chunk from the actual wealth producers . The financial industry -- according to free market theory , and just the fact of the evolution of computers and electronic financial transactions -- should become more efficient over time , not less . Instead we have allowed the financial sector to skim off money from pools of wealth that they add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation . When Mitt Romney steals money from a retirement fund that was meant to feed and clothe old people , he sees that as profit and therefore wealth creation . He is honestly confused that the former employees are upset . <p> Well said . What 's just so darn depressing -- among a host of realities about which to be depressed -- is how true the adage is of " not knowing history means doomed to repeat it . " <p> We 've been down this road before . Not too long ago , in fact . Neo-feudalism is pretty much where we are . And to be sure that many people do n't know their history , they make sure education is outsourced and diluted . Social Studies did n't used to be a bad word . <p> I agree that Romney is dishonest , but I think in a tactical way . He will say what whatever it takes to reach his objective . But I do think those lies are in the service of what he believes to be a larger " truth " -- that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for the economy , and so do most of the people attending this party . <p> I think this helps explain the animosity on the part of these people against health care funding , social security , unemployment benefits . etc . If there are not diseased beggars dying at your gates how can you tell you 're rich ? <p> I think this helps explain the animosity on the part of these people against health care funding , social security , unemployment benefits . etc . If there are not diseased beggars dying at your gates how can you tell you 're rich ? <p> If it was just about being rich , the post-New Deal Keynesian state still guaranteed them profits beyond their wildest dreams and a position in society that 90% of the public could only dream of -- even with the Eisenhower-era tax rates . It 's not about money . Status and power have a lot more to do with it , IMHO . <p> It 's not about money . Status and power have a lot more to do with it , IMHO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status flows from having more money -- not just having more money than thousands of us combined , but from having a few more dollars than their peers , or a slightly bigger yacht , etc . A bunch of Babbitts that do n't care if their slightly-lower taxes come at the expense of actual suffering and death among the untouchables . <p> @ patrick II : They are honest and sincere in their disdain for the common man . <p> Who gives a shit that they are ? And I still think you are giving them too much credit . If he(they) were honestly assessing the financial situation they would not come to the same conclusions . Because if they were doing this honestly they would have to take into account the entire world around them and not just the bubble they live in . Their entire lives are dishonest . It 's not the money that makes them dishonest it 's their attitude and arrogance at the mistaken belief that they are special because of the money . <p> It really does n't help when former Democratic donors simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and former wife of pardoned billionaire trader Marc Rich , has given up her U.S. citizenship -- and , with it , much of her U.S. tax bill . Rich , 68 , a Grammy-nominated songwriter and glossy figure in Democratic and European royalty circles , renounced her American passport in November , according to her lawyer . Her maiden name , Denise Eisenberg , appeared in the Federal Register on April 30 in a quarterly list of Americans who renounced their U.S. citizenship and permanent residents who handed in their green cards . By dumping her U.S. passport , Rich likely will save tens of millions of dollars or more in U.S. taxes over the long haul , tax lawyers say . <p> What do they know that we do n't 
##114852 <h> When it comes to big-time sports , it 's an infinite season <p> View full size William Neff , The Plain Dealer Does sports -- particularly professional sports -- seem on a never-ending treadmill ? You would n't be wrong . " Fans have an insatiable appetite for sports and the leagues want to deliver it to remain relevant , " says David Carter , executive director of the USC Sports Business Institute . " Leagues do not want to give up the floor and they can not afford to go dormant for several months at a time . " <p> CLEVELAND , Ohio -- Eight years ago , the Cavaliers were one of six NBA teams to play in the inaugural Las Vegas summer league , an event that drew few fans , required only one open concessions stand and was run out of the briefcase of basketball agent Warren LeGarie . <p> The fledgling league and others like it provided competition for teams to acclimate their rookies and give other young players a chance to hone parts of their game . <p> As the Vegas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2007 , marketing it as the first opportunity for fans to see future stars.Naturally , they made room for it on NBA TV , a 24-hour cable network bereft of much live off-season programming . It 's where over the next eight days fans will watch rookies Dion Waiters and Tyler Zeller as part of NBA TV 's 60-game , summer-league presentation . <p> Never mind the Indians are barely out of the All-Star break and the Browns are two weeks from training camp . The Cavaliers and the NBA are finding their audience three months before their first exhibition game . <p> " Fans want to stay connected to their teams and I think it 's a good thing , " Cavaliers General Manager Chris Grant said . " We see the passion , particularly in our part of the country , and we know fans want to get as much information about the team as possible . " <p> Such is the reality of pro sports today . The confluence of year-round training , free agency and a growing media presence has virtually eliminated what we know as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pitchers and catchers reporting to training camp while football ended with the last missed tackle of the Pro Bowl . Now , the sports calendar is dotted with combines , organized team activities and made-for-TV specials like the ESPYs . <p> It produces surreal scenes like the one on July 4 in Columbus , as more than 350 fans spent part of their holiday in Nationwide Arena 's auxiliary rink watching the Blue Jackets conduct development camp . Because what says Fourth of July like hockey practice ? <p> " Fans have an insatiable appetite for sports and the leagues want to deliver it to remain relevant , " said David Carter , executive director of the USC Sports Business Institute . " Leagues do not want to give up the floor and they can not afford to go dormant for several months at a time . " <p> Phil Simms , former NFL quarterback and CBS analyst , is more succinct : " It 's about money and finding ways to make more of it . " <p> The NFL , which reported $9 billion in revenues last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add two more regular season games to its schedule . <p> The NBA , with its nearly $4 billion in revenue in the 2000-11 season , continues to enable its players to participate in the Summer Olympics . <p> More exposure generates greater interest , Carter said , and ultimately leads to new revenue streams . ESPN analyst and former basketball coach Jeff Van Gundy understands it 's good for business , but wonders at what cost . <p> " I do n't know anyone in the NBA who has four weeks off anymore , " he said . <p> When did sports evolve into year-round enterprises for teams and athletes ? How did we get from Leroy Kelly running for a 100 yards on autumn Sunday afternoons to Hines Ward dancing with the stars in primetime ? <p> Some believe the genesis dates to Sept. 21 , 1970 in Cleveland . <p> " Like watching grass grow " <p> Desperate to improve its primetime ratings , ABC took a risk by moving one NFL game per week to Monday night . <p> The telecasts were about more than just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders -- controversial story lines and irreverence like they had never experienced . It started with this introduction from a provocateur who had no previous NFL experience : <p> " It is a hot , sultry , almost windless night at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland , Ohio where the Browns will play host to the New York Jets . ... Good evening everyone , I 'm Howard Cosell and welcome to ABC 's Monday night primetime National Football League television series . " <p> Carter and Joe Horrigan of the Pro Football Hall of Fame agree that Monday Night Football attracted more casual fans and different sponsors . It also demonstrated to sports and television executives that fans were willing to follow their teams and favorite players outside their normal settings . Boundaries began to stretch . <p> Cosell 's rants had folks talking around the office water coolers for days and fans waited all week to see if their team 's highlights made the halftime cut . <p> The first telecast set the tone for how sports and entertainment would become yoked . It was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fair Hooker , that 's a great name , is n't it ? " Don Meredith said of the Browns receiver . " But I have n't met one yet . " <p> Spurred by its innovative success , ABC launched a primetime competition in 1973 called " Superstars , " pitting athletes from various sports against each other . America saw Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Lynn Swann nimbly negotiate obstacle courses and heavyweight boxer Joe Frazier nearly drown in a pool . Sports figures no longer needed to be in season to be seen or discussed . <p> The advent of baseball free agency in 1975 got fans chatting through the offseason about ways their teams could improve and Pete Franklin and the burgeoning genre of sports talk radio offered them the platform to voice their opinions . <p> " I can remember people around the league saying , ' Who would watch the draft ? It will be like watching grass grow . ' " Horrigan recalled .

##156051 <h> Venue <h> Cast <h> Director <h> Writer <p> Lynn Nottage <h> The Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright of " Ruined " addresses the quandaries facing African-American artists in early 1930s Hollywood , first in the moment and then in hindsight . <p> By the Way , Meet Vera Stark is a quicksilver construction , blending disparate elements of genre parody , academic cant , broad humor , social comment and legitimate pathos while manipulating layers of irony , some blatant , others transparent , and still more downright subtle . Inspired by the career of bit player Theresa Harris , whose saucily subversive portrayals of maids subsisted on being memorable in the moment and forgotten the next , the play adopts a strategy not unlike that of the recent Clybourne Park : a first act positing an alternative reality to a well-known historical dramatic situation , and a second one set in later decades which presents a reinterpretation of the earlier event in the context of contemporary mores . It 's a highly theatrical concept that avoids nearly all the considerable pitfalls of such ambition in a high-wire act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first act is set in the digs of an increasingly desperate star , Gloria Mitchell ( Amanda Detmer ) , formerly " America 's Sweetie Pie , " running lines with her maid Vera Stark ( Sanaa Lathan ) for an audition to play a tragic octaroon in an antebellum romance . With more talent as a drama queen than for drama , Gloria depends completely on Vera 's support , while Vera , herself an aspiring hopeful , fails to enlist her support in seeking the coveted role of the lead 's maid , an actual if not genuine character for a black actress to play ( " It has lines ! " ) . Manning and Bonney play this first act as a gloss on classic screwball comedy stylings ( although in 1933 , they had not yet quite coalesced into the form depicted ) , from the three distaff roommates on the make in the big town ( here refreshingly all-black , though one is passing as Brazilian to further her career ) to the farcical party with the main action unseen in the back patio as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play in character , and as their characters impersonating the roles they are constrained to play , while teasingly commenting on both . <p> Playwright Lynn Nottage also flirts with the conventions of race imagery of the period from Imitation of Life to , inevitably , Gone with the Wind . Thankfully she also pays full homage not only to the trailblazing sacrifices of black actors but also to the value of their craft , of any craft , even in service to demeaning stereotypes . When I was growing up , my first reaction to seeing black actors in caricatured parts was satisfaction that an artist had a job , was visible and working ( especially during the Great Depression ) , even when the circumstances conspired to reinforce the greater invisibility of the race . This perspective was no longer viable by 1973 , where the second act takes up Vera and Gloria appearing on a cheesy Las Vegas television interview show , and criticism had become a central gesture of liberation . And by 2003 , where a panel of scholars debates the meaning of what went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has morphed into a series of referential delusions , where facts are manufactured to fit more enlightened forms of prejudice in the name of a flexible view of " history . " Nottage satirically observes that the constant across the eras is how determined society is to see what it wants to see . <p> All the actors are deft , poised with self-awareness without descending into self-consciousness . Lathan as Vera is naturally the most dazzlingly kaleidoscopic , always grounded throughout flights of imaginative fancy worthy of a character in a George Cukor movie . Bonney generally encourages the company to play very broadly , which serves to cue the audience reliably where to laugh , although it regrettably also encourages a sort of knowing superiority to the situations that I believe undercuts the essential sincerity of the characters ' subterfuges and enterprise . Amanda Detmer perhaps has the most difficult role to bring off , and while not immune to posturing outside of character as well as within , she does bring a welcome and surprising gravitas to Gloria as an elderly lady not entirely reformed from self-absorption . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat her way into Mammy typecasting , resorts to so many period hand-gestures with such ferocious dexterity that one can not tell when she is overdone or simply very sly . Merle Dandridge ' s dual turn as sexpot and lesbian ideologue sticks tightest to type yet her stage presence electrifies . And I was especially taken with the nuance of Kevin T. Carroll ' s Leroy Barksdale , a trumpeter working as chauffeur to a director and future doomed husband to Vera , whose relatively stock part reveals depths of charm and gradations of finely-distilled feeling , for which credit is due some skillful dialogue as well as the sort of thoughtful acting which eschews all show . <p> Disappointingly unsuccessful is the use of filmed excerpts from the putative classic The Belle of New Orleans , which marks Vera 's breakthrough part . While deployed for novelty value and to add additional dimensions of depiction to the mix , the film is shockingly shot in the wrong aspect ratio and lit in an anachronistic style of at least a decade later , and the unfortunate decision to " distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of jeans seems tantamount to running silent films at a herky-jerky speed , the wrong kind of distancing device that only encourages audiences to misunderstand and dismiss the aesthetics of classical cinema . In a final irony , the talent manifested elsewhere in Lathan 's portrayal is tough to discern ( although the point of a black actor seizing the dramatic climax is neatly taken ) , which 
##157751 <h> Playoff plan to run through 2025 <p> WASHINGTON , D.C. -- A four-team playoff for college football has been formally approved by a presidential oversight committee , a dramatic change for the sport that will begin in 2014 and continue through the 2025 season . The four teams will be chosen by a selection committee , the semifinals will be held at current bowl sites and the national championship game will be awarded to the highest bidder . <h> More From ESPN.com <p> Kudos and congratulations to all the people that finally made a college football playoff a reality , Gene Wojciechowski writes . Story <p> The BCS is dead , but many questions remain , ranging from selection criteria to revenue distribution , Mark Schlabach writes . Story <p> The 11 conference commissioners watched on Tuesday afternoon as Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick presented their proposal to a board of 12 university presidents at the Dupont Circle Hotel . In less than three hours , the group agreed upon a postseason that college football fans have been clamoring for years . <p> The group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six bowl sites and a rotation of the championship game among neutral sites . The semifinals either will be played on New Year 's Eve or New Year 's Day , and the national title game will be played on " Championship Monday , " the first Monday in January that is six or more days after the final semifinal game is played . <p> " A four-team playoff does n't go too far ; it goes just the right amount , " said Virginia Tech president Charles Sterger , chair of the presidential oversight committee . " We are very pleased with this arrangement even though some issues &; remain to be finalized . " <p> There will be three contract bowls -- the Champions Bowl , which is a partnership between the Big 12 and SEC , the Rose Bowl , which has a longstanding tradition between the Big Ten and Pac 12 , and a bowl to be determined for the ACC , which is likely to continue its partnership with the Orange Bowl . <p> " In terms of our contract bowl , and our New Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that jointly in the very near future , " Swofford said . <h> ESPNU College Football <p> Ivan Maisel and Beano Cook share their thoughts on the new format for college football 's postseason that will begin in 2014 . Plus , your emails . <p> The three other bowls , called " access bowls , " have yet to be determined , but the decision will force the Sugar Bowl and Fiesta Bowl to become bidders . <p> Tuesday 's decision possibly could squeeze the Big East out of the postseason , as its champion is no longer guaranteed a spot in one of the six major bowls . The " automatic qualifiers " label also will disappear in the new system and those programs will have no guaranteed access to the new structure . Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby called it an " open marketplace for all schools .

" <h> Here 's What We Do n't Know <p> The BCS may be gone , but there are still plenty of questions about the new playoff system : <p> Who will be on the committee that selects seeded teams ? What format will the committee use to choose the seeded teams ? How will the money be split among conferences ? Will teams from non-automatic qualifying conferences have access to the tournament ? <p> The championship game will be managed by the conferences and will not be branded as a bowl game . The presidents also announced the creation of a selection committee that will rank the teams to play in the playoff , " giving all the teams an equal opportunity to participate . " The committee will consider win-loss record , strength of schedule , head-to-head results and whether a team is a conference champion . <p> The two main topics that still need further discussion are how teams will be selected and how revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to how the revenue will be divided , according to Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany , but that has not been made public yet . The commissioners also still need to decide a name for the playoff . <p> The decision is subject to passage of appropriate legislation by the NCAA Board of Directors to permit the two semifinal winners to play an additional postseason game . <p> ACC commissioner John Swofford called it " a milestone " for college football . <p> " The access for conferences throughout the FBS is going to be better in this system than the current system , " he said .

It 's influenced by bright , vivid sci-fi , and real-world functional spaceship design to go with 0x10c 's realistic tone . <p> " The idea is to give people flexible in-game tools for creativity , and have the outcome look fantastic no matter how they piece things together .

##191152 <h> Thursday , October 25 , 2012 <p> At first they are mere whispers in fog of information overload , but as time wears on those whispers amplify more and more , before resonating as a shriek . <p> In starting pharmacy school it seems as if the world is yours for the taking . For years you followed the predefined path , reading the likes of Socrates and learning the detailed psychology of the human mind . And in arriving in pharmacy school , you feel as if you are finally about to reach your life 's true aspirations . <p> And then a funny thing happens . That hopefulness , that strong desire for learning is slowly chipped away like waves crashing against a cliff . Eventually you become a shell of yourself , merely moving through the motions and responding to questions when asked . <p> Someone once drew a parallel to boot camp in the army , where we are all broken down in an attempt to rebuild our minds and internal processes as professionals . <p> But at what cost ? <p> Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices of paranoia . The overwhelming sense that , at any point , you will be labeled a failure . Not just in your mind , but in the minds of your family and your peers . For every professor that is there to support you , there is always one or more who seemingly relish in making you squirm . <p> So your paranoia grows . It consumes you . It dictates your actions in every aspect of your life . <p> Did I put my shoes on the correct feet this morning ? Did I shut off the light in the kitchen ? Did I sign my name correctly ? <p> The latter may sound silly to some , but when your hounded about signing with proper credentials every week it is something you become acutely aware of . It is at this point that you realize you have been broken , reduced to merely a puppet in the confines of pharmacy school . <p> But it is at this point where you rebuild . The light at the end of the proverbial tunnel begins to grow and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is asked about why oxybutinin causes dry mouth and , without thinking , you start describing it 's anti-cholinergic properties . <p> Maybe you can do this . Maybe this seemingly unending and unnerving mount of information you have been presented with has , in some way , become ingrained in your mind . Maybe once you were broken , but now you have become what you have always wanted ... a healthcare professional . <p> And slowly those voices begin to quiet , first down to a whisper before ultimately vanishing completely . In some ways you are finally mentally at peace . <p> Yet ... you still feel incomplete . As if the sacrifices made you into a new person at the cost of who you were . Whether that is a good or bad thing remains unseen , but it leaves one with a tantalizing question . <h> Sunday , April 22 , 2012 <p> For the uninitiated , Rho Chi is the organization that rewards those who academically perform well in pharmacy school , and then grant them with acceptance into their prestigious organization . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the crowning achievements of your academic career . It is only when you finally become buried in the life of a pharmacy student that you realize what an actual farce this is . <p> In my experience , those who are in Rho Chi typically do n't know what the hell they 're talking about in practical situations . Sure they can recite every side effect of lamotrigine and they may know proper UHF dosing guidelines in a patient with VTE or ACS ... provided everything is answered on a scan-tron form . <p> In a real world setting , most often emulated via our case studies , these successful " methods " no longer apply . Therapeutic suggestions are aimlessly justified because of what it said in a slide . Or , even worse , they wo n't know what a specific agent is or does , as they merely memorized it for the exam . <p> These are the " elite " pharmacy students we are told we should strive to be . It is the first of many seemingly unimportant carrots that are dangled in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a generalization and there are several Rho Chi members who do not fit this mold , but it still does not change my belief on the illegitimacy of defining success in this manner . As practitioners , we will not see success because of our ability to remember minute details , we will see success based upon our ability to logically apply our knowledge in practical situations <p> So you know what , I 'm damn proud to be part of Lo Chi . <p> I may occasionally meet the average for exams , and even more rarely exceed it , but at the end of the day I know that I will still be a damn good practitioner .. perhaps one better than those Rho Chi members . <p> For the rest of you exhausted pharmers , aching for the end of the semester I say raise a glass of your favorite booze/caffeinated substance and toast the recognition of the most truly glorious organization in pharmacy school . <h> Tuesday , January 31 , 2012 <p> There are things that we are told growing up that make our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding in our closet . Our friends speak of ghosts hiding in an old abandoned house in town . And our counterparts in pharmacy school speak in dire tones when discussing the second year of pharmacy school . <p> One person will say it 's the most terrible experience of their life . Another describes endless nights of not sleeping in order to memorize materials . Professors will warn you that it will shake you to the very core of your being . <p> I 'll let you in on a little secret ... it 's not as bad as they say it is . <p> Do n't get me wrong , the amount of material is daunting , the wealth of examinations can be overwhelming . <p> At the end of the day though , it 's not any worse than first year . Actually , I have found second year to be easier than our first year . <p> Part of the reason is that you cover topics in multiple courses . Med chem will talk about SSRIs , SNRIs , and TCAs , and then pharmacology will discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same classes in therapy . You are , in effect , exposed to the material in three , or more , separate courses , often with a slightly different perspective . <p> In a way , you are being tested on the material three different times and , eventually , you realize that you have actually learned said material . <p> Yes , there are shitty lectures that will leave you confused . Yes , kinetics is the STD of pharmacy school which seemingly does not go away . When you part the clouds and look at the year as a whole , it 's truly not that bad . <p> Granted I have had to learn how to budget my time due to working and having a child . I 'm not " missing out " on getting wasted every weekend like I have heard so many classmates claim so far . But with a little organization and a little budgeting of time , it is completely doable . <p> So for you first years looking forward to next year with a sense of dread , heed my advice ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 5 , 2012 <p> Much is being made about the spat between Expess Scripts ( ESI ) and Walgreen 's ( WAG ) over their latest contract . While privately many in the industry appear to be siding with Walgreen 's for finally standing up for the profession for reasons listed here , pubically it appears a more even split . <p> Many decry the terrible burden this is for patients , as they are left to be pushed around by big business when it comes to the management of their health . Others are screaming that it is unfair for the pharmacy employees , as they are merely overworked pawns in this mess . <p> But with change comes sacrifice , does it not ? No one will argue that the business side of pharmacy has been on a dangerous downward spiral for the last 10+ years . So why is it that when an organization is finally starting to stand firm against this spiral , that so many are speaking out against it ? <p> Perhaps we need to simplify what this argument is all about and explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For a quick overview of the Economics of Pharmacy , check out the associated link . No , it is not college level macroeconomics , but for many who have not directly experienced it , it does describes what the business environment is like . And , if you 'll note , I have a rather accurate prediction in my closing statement . <p> How pharmacies are paid is quite simple , you are given an amount for the cost of a drug and a " filling " or " service " fee for actually filling the prescription . <p> Note that the average overhead cost of filling a prescription , before the cost of the drug , is roughly $10 . That includes wages , supplies , building expenses and so on . Again , that 's $10 for every prescription , irregardless of the cost of the medication . <p> When it comes to how pharmacies are paid for the cost of the drug is where it becomes tricky . Essentially there is a fictitious average price called the Average Wholesale Price ( AWP ) that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fictitious price typically is not line with the actual cost , so a lot of times you 'll be paid what 's called AWP - 10% , which is 90% of the AWP price . <p> The percentages vary and there are additional systems involved , but this is generally how pharmacy economics function . Now let 's run some numbers on a fictional script . <p> Now you 'll notice , due to the AWP , that the pharmacy is actually paid more than the cost of the drug on this prescription . You 'll then notice that the pharmacy was only paid $1.50 ( 15% ) of the total $10.00 it costs to dispense this drug . <p> Believe it or not , this last fact is very common , something which pharmacies have been lashing out against for years now . And , from what I 've heard , it is this sticking point which is at the heart of the ESI/WAG stalemate . <p> Various reports have stated that ESI wanted to decrease their dispensing fee to $0.40 , that is 4% of the total cost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How do pharmacies stay in business if they lose money like this ? " With some prescriptions , namely branded drugs , the prices used to calculate cost are somewhat more accurate and they have higher margins due to their higher cost . <p> The last article I read placed the average cost of a generic drug , for a month supply , at around $10.00 while the average price of a branded drug , for a month supply , is around $80.00 . A higher cost allows more wiggle room if you will , and it is these drugs which subsidize the losses on other prescriptions . <p> The second question then becomes , " Well the fee is already low , you subsidize the cost with other prescriptions and it 's only dropping a $1.10 , what 's the big deal ? " <p> One of the ways in which pharmacy is evolving is that the percentage of generic drugs being used is increasing . The new drug pipeline has dried up considerably in recent years and blockbuster drugs like Lipitor , Prilosec and Claritin probably will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . <p> If you are dispensing fewer and fewer of the name branded products which counteract your losses on other drugs , it becomes increasingly important that you try to mitigate your losses on those other drugs . Pharmacies have been able to survive thus far on the backbone of strong , brand name drugs , but clearly this will not last forever . <p> Granted , this is a greatly simplified view of what the entire disagreement is all about . One could talk about the effect of the Walmart $4 generic program or government regulation or consumer indifference to the profession itself , but quite simply this is what it boils down to . <p> You can not fault Walgreen 's for being the first to finally stand up to one of the monster PBMs in this country . The fact of the matter is that Express Scripts needs Walgreen 's more than Walgreen 's needs Express Scripts . <p> ESI has no equity with the consumer aside from whatever experience they may have with a help line . Walgreen 's has a face , a voice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as big of power move by Walgreen 's as we may perhaps ever see . <p> While it 's competitors enjoy the new business and take advantage of the situation , I 'm sure deep in their corperate offices they are secretly cheering WAGs on as they could be next in the lines of these cuts . <p> This is n't about lining the pockets of the Walgreen 's CEOs or it 's investors . This is n't about making a pharmacy a cash cow . It is about taking a stand for what is financially right not only for pharmacy as a profession , but for patients as well . If we want optimal , efficient healthcare , we have to be paid a fair price for this service . <p> Remember this is not about making more money , this is about saving what little money they are making ... if any . <p> And that , my friends , is why Walgreen 's and Express Scripts are in a stand off of historic proportions . Perhaps it 's not so bad after all ... <h> Monday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , what stoked the fires of my soul was pharmacy . I loved every minute of being in one and would do everything I could to absorb myself in the profession . My desk was littered with trade magazines , my computer flooded with pharmacy websites and even this little site here was born out of this fit of passion . <p> And while time was worn on and I find myself questioning that passion at times , it nonetheless is still flickering . The new fire in my life is my family , but becoming a pharmacist is ingrained in my being after my experiences these past ten years . It is , in many way , what defines me not only for myself , but for many of the people who know me . <p> So why do I not see this in my classmates ? Why do I not see this in my co-workers ? Why do I not see this in the majority of pharmacists , 63 and counting , that I have worked with over the years ? <p> Where is that passion in others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is out there , fleeting as it may be . No matter where I have found myself , I have always had a pharmacist near by who truly cared about the profession . They saw what I saw , yet felt our hands tied in numerous situations . <p> My classmates seemingly go through the motions of school , jumping when professors say jump and barking when they say bark . Excitement is extruded over cute little informational clinics , the next frat get together , or the idea of an exam being over . We are tested on regurgitating classes of drugs , signs of a disorder and how to dictate a therapy . <p> Yet there is no passion in these discussions . For many , it 's just more school ... a means to an ends if you will . <p> Again , there are those who feel this passion , who want to see change or wish to envision pharmacy as something more than it is right now . Perhaps it is not as surprising that those of us have found each other to varying degrees as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . <p> But we need more passion . <p> The disillusion in the profession still astounds me . Retail pharmacy is slowly devolving into a profession of puppets , only doing what corporate lays out for them to do no matter their desires . It is almost as if we are living in a George Orwellian 1984 and information is relayed in pharmacy doublespeak . <p> " Patient 's are of the utmost importance to our business ! ... But you 're going to be understaffed , only allowing you to spend a brief moment , if at all with them . " <p> It is as confounding as it is frustrating . And I can completely understand why those who say they came out of pharmacy school ready to change the world , only to have their hopes and dreams squashed by reality . <p> My question is why give up ? Why let that passion die ? Why must so many pharmacists and students be so apathetic ? <p> " Time is the fire in which we burn . " - Delmore Schwartz <p> Above is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our time is ultimately limited and that we need not waste it with frivolous activities . Live life and have fun , but do not waste it away merely doing what corporate says . <p> Find that passion . Fuel it and stoke its fires . Take that extra second with your patient not only to show you care , but to show yourself that you can do what you want . <p> We do not have to be pawns in a corporate game . We are professionals and we deserve to be treated like so . Stand up for what you believe is right and where you 're passion for pharmacy proudly . After all 
##194252 <h> Happier Couples Travel in the Same Direction <p> Here at eHarmony , we know that similarity on key attributes ( including personalities , values , and emotions ) is important to having a successful relationship . But how far can this similarity basis go ? <p> Recent research examined the daily commutes of married couples in the US and in China . Interestingly , the researchers found that those married couples who commuted in the same direction every day were on average more satisfied than those who commuted to opposite sides of town . This finding was still evident after controlling for length of marriage , gender , income , time of commute , and if the couple left at the same time or not . <p> The researchers also replicated their finding in a college setting . They paired together students who had not met before , and sent them to " complete an exercise " in another room and given directions to get there . Some pairs went separately to rooms on the same side of a building using similar routes , and others using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms on opposite sides of the building . The researchers found that all students who travelled towards the same side of the building rated their random partner as more positive than those who travelled to opposite sides of the building . <p> The researchers explain that these results could be an extension of having similar goals in general . Commuting in the same general direction every day could create a sense of sharing other goals or destinations in life , which can in turn create a more satisfying relationship . <p> Do you and your partner commute in the same direction every day ?

##200352 <p> Sinofsky had been at Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) since 1989 , trusted with overseeing many of the company 's core products , including Office and , most recently , Windows . At one point , he served as former CEO Bill Gates ' technical adviser . <p> After building a reputation for delivering products successfully and on time , Sinofsky was given command of a Windows division in turmoil . Windows Vista had been a debacle of a release , and Microsoft needed someone to restore consumers ' trust in its flagship product . Sinofsky was credited with turning Windows around and delivering Windows 7 on time and to rave reviews . It would became Microsoft 's best-selling version of the operating system . <p> The new operating system and tablet have received mostly positive reviews , but analysts say consumer adoption has been tepid as users are slow to embrace the all-new user interface . <p> At the Windows 8 launch event in late October , Sinofsky certainly was n't talking like an executive who was about to leave . Like Scott Forstall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was shown the door following that company 's Maps snafu , Sinofsky had a reputation as a taskmaster and was not particularly well-liked by other executives . Microsoft also has a habit of alienating or ushering out top talent whose star power begins to rival that of Ballmer . <p> But Sinofsky was conciliatory in his outgoing statement , unlike some recent departures -- most notably former software chief Ray Ozzie 's smackdown of Microsoft 's corporate culture two years ago . <p> " It is impossible to count the blessings I have received over my years at Microsoft , " Sinofsky said in a statement . " I am humbled by the professionalism and generosity of everyone I have had the good fortune to work with at this awesome company . " <p> Ballmer was considerably less nostalgic , simply saying that he was " grateful for the many years of work that Steven has contributed to the company , " before talking about the succession plan . <p> Julie Larson-Green , Sinofsky 's top lieutenant , will take the reins of the Windows division . After Sinofsky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was often Microsoft 's choice for product demonstrations at key press and developer events since the operating system was first unveiled in September 2011 . <p> In an interview with CNNMoney at the Windows 8 launch event , he dismissed criticism that Windows 8 would be too difficult for consumers to understand . He noted that the new " Start " screen gestures are simple enough for Windows users to grasp quickly . <p> He began to tell a story about how he was recently buying a new car , picking the same make and model as the reliable 10-year old car he was trading in . But he said when he got in the new car , he could n't figure out how to start it up . <p> " I sat in the car , and had no idea where to put the keys , " he said .

Fareed speaks with two former U.S. treasury secretaries who represent both sides of the political aisle : Robert Rubin and Paul O'Neill . <p> Earlier this week , writing in the New York Times , Rubin tackled the arguments surrounding the so-called fiscal cliff , the looming combination of automatic spending cuts and tax increases that kick in at the start of next year unless Republicans and Democrats in Washington can agree a deal .

Speculation among Chinese netizens on Weibo microblog sites , and among in-the-know Hong Kong and Taiwanese media , was that younger local leaders such as Guangdong Party Secretary Wang Yang ( 57 ) , who had deftly responded to local protests and stepped in to replace unpopular local leaders beneath him , would constitute the majority of the incoming PBSC . <p> Editor 's note : Peter Petri is a nonresident senior fellow with the East-West Center , a professor of international finance at Brandeis University and visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .

The views expressed are his own . <p> Afghan President Hamid Karzai 's visit this week to India highlighted the strengthening relationship between the two countries . While India has invested heavily in a range of development projects in Afghanistan since 2002 , its emergence as a political player is relatively new , considering that as recently as January 2010 , and under Pakistani pressure , India was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Deteriorating relations between the United States and Pakistan , and the subsequent announcement of 2014 as the year of " transition " changed the West 's attitude towards India 's role . By June of this year , U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was urging India to play a more active role in Afghanistan . <p> While there had been speculation prior to Karzai 's India visit that the two countries would agree to scale up training of Afghan army officers , in the end the main focus was on economic engagement . Under the Istanbul process of regional engagement , India had already agreed to lead work on increasing regional interaction among chambers of commerce , and on commercial opportunities in the region . It has also hosted an investment summit for Afghanistan . On the trip , Karzai reiterated that Afghanistan was open to Indian business . <p> Hayat Sindi is co-founder of Diagnostics for All and founder of the i2 institute , which is launching in Jeddah today .

Policy makers and analysts should learn from the deadly attack and review how the U.S. government and others can help Libya build stability and security after 42 years of dictatorship . <p> Here are some ideas to start that conversation . First , encourage and help Libya develop security forces that can operate with the professionalism , transparency and accountability that were absent for four decades under Moammar Gadhafi . Libya desperately needs effective military and police . But these forces should break with past practice and serve the public under the rule of law rather than the interests of one man . <p> The visit is the culmination of painstaking preparatory work by his senior officials -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , Defense Secretary Leon Panetta , and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk -- who have assiduously put flesh on the bones of Obama 's rebalancing strategy toward Asia . Obama 's trip could add substantially by providing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trade , investment , aid , security , governance , diplomacy , and culture .

The views expressed are those of the authors . <p> Partisan bickering in Washington has overwhelmed even the discussion of U.S. national security , an area that used to be fenced from Beltway infighting . Yet not only is national security too important to leave to simplistic posturing , it is an area that should prompt a great deal of agreement . As evidence , we -- a group of 15 Republican , Democratic , and independent former policymakers , retired military officers , and academics -- reached a solid consensus on a new U.S. defense strategy for the future . And even we were surprised how easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmingly superior to those of any potential adversary , or combination of adversaries , and will likely remain so for years to come because of the dedication of our uniformed men and women and the high priority U.S. taxpayers have long put on national defense . American space , air , naval , and special operations forces make it possible for the U.S. to reach virtually any spot on the globe in a timely manner , whether to destroy targets or deliver humanitarian goods -- and , together with our ground components , to sustain such campaigns for considerable periods of time . These forces have unprecedented flexibility , agility , reach , precision , and lethality , providing capabilities that seemed like distant visions not many years ago . Military superiority , however , does not translate into military omnipotence . U.S. capabilities to fight protracted wars on the ground , to defeat insurgencies , to stabilize governance , and to ensure security for societies in distant regions are limited , at best .

The views expressed are his own . <p> On September 18 , 1978 , Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin signed the so-called Camp David Accords , cementing the notion that land for peace would become the basis for a resolution of the Arab-Israel conflict . Their agreement led to a peace treaty the following year between Israel and Egypt . However the current fighting between Israel and Palestinian groups in the Gaza Strip ends , one thing is certain : the era of land-for-peace is over . <p> At first , Jimmy Carter 's land-for-peace formula looked promising .

##210752 <h> Friday , 16 November 2012 <p> Happy Friday everyone ! Today 's inspiration point is undeniably similar to last week 's lace yoke detail sweatshirt dress ! That lace yoke dress was well received so I thought I 'd offer a variation so people can see how else to interpret the basic idea . <p> As you may well have figured out , the basic dress has been made in exactly the same way as last week 's , using two unwanted men 's sweatshirts that are the same colour . As you can see if the image above , one of the sweatshirts was a raglan style so the final dress has ended up with this cool shoulder seam effect ( if you are wondering why the image below does n't have those seams , it is because I made a few of these dresses and ended up photographing a couple ) . <p> I wanted to keep the red dress really fun and youthful , so I used some candy-striped cotton to make simple bows and applied them to the shoulders . Winter and cold-weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to make something bright yet still snug and warm . You could really amp up the effect by combining this dress with equally bright and vivid coloured tights ! <p> How about you ? Do you have any strategies for avoiding drabness when dressing for Winter weather ? <h> Monday , 12 November 2012 <p> If ever the was a publication that proved craft and sewing has moved on from it 's stuffy , old-fashioned image it 's ' Just Sew Stories ' by Katie Allen . It would take a week to explain to your grandma all the influences and cultural references behind the projects in this neon-hued book . It is interesting that Allen ( who is a regular contributor to Mollie Makes magazine ) references her grandmothers as her source of inspiration in the introduction of this book , but you can not deny that she has taken the techniques they taught her ( cross-stitch , patch work , hand embroidery etc. ) and translated them in a direction that is very much her own and for her generation . <p> The design of this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and geometric elements make flicking through this book a joy . As with most books of this ilk , she starts by imparting some basic techniques that you 'll need to complete the projects within . But this is no detailed ' How to Sew ' book : mastering skills is not the objective here . You get just enough under your belt to get going with the projects , so if you are looking for a comprehensive sewing guide , you 'd best look elsewhere . But in this sense it is perfect for it 's intended audience . <p> The projects include appliqud glasses case , sequinned hair fascinator and bloomers . They are cute , fun and quick . But I 'm not going to pretend otherwise : this book probably is n't for the readers of my blog , not even the younger ones . This book is for their teenage-ish daughters or little sisters : individuals who have expressed an interest in making stuff but do n't currently have the patience and/or desire to master a sewing machine or figure out sewing/knitting patterns . Obvs I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and little brothers too , but alas vintage-style aprons , retro head bands and puffy bloomers are unlikely to draw many young creative dudes . However , the projects are ' cool ' enough for the teen market who would like to have a bash at them ( I 'd imagine ) but also quick enough to get a finished result before Hollyoaks or Skins comes on the telly . <p> The eagle-eyed of you will have noticed that this post is another instalment of my Giveaway Monday series , so it may not surprise you to learn that I have one copy to give to a lovely reader of my blog . And with Christmas coming up , this giveaway could be a great opportunity to encourage the creativity of a young crafter or crafter-to-be at no expense to yourself ! Unlike the ' Sew Over It ' book I gave away a couple of weeks ago , I do n't have the publisher stumping up the postage this time , and because books are heavy and I am skint , I 'm afraid this week 's giveaway is UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave a comment in the comments section of this post telling me why you fancy getting hold of a copy of ' Just Sew Stories ' ( no reason , I 'm just nosey ) . If I ca n't access your email address within two clicks , please include it in your entry comment . Email addresses will not be used for anything other than to contact you if you are the lucky winner of this giveaway . To reiterate , this giveaway is open to residents of the UK only and the winner will receive the book completely free of charge . The giveaway entries will close at midnight GMT Sunday 18th November and the winner will be chosen by random number generator and contacted Monday 19th November October . Good luck , my UK-based , book-loving friends ! <h> Friday , 9 November 2012 <p> If you are somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere that is as chilly as my studio in Brighton , you may be looking at this dress and thinking , ' That 's what I need ' ! That 's a damn cosy dress pictured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm thinking a long-sleeved T-shirt underneath ( something like Winnie 's , perhaps ) , woolly grey tights , boots and a mustard cardigan ! <p> If this refashioned/remade garment is looking a bit familiar to you , it 's because it is a reworking of a previous idea . The grey sweatshirt I made for myself and the navy version I made for Jane share the same lace yoke detail . However , for the dress I went for short puff sleeves rather than the 3/4 length ones , and added a skirt section . This remake took two second-hand men 's navy sweatshirts which were thankfully almost exactly the same shade . It 's semi-fitted and just pulls on with no fastenings . I used the original neck ribbing to remake the new neck finishing , and harvested one of the waist band ribbing to fashion the sleeve cuffs . There was , joyously , very little wasted sweatshirts at the end of this remake . <p> As with most refashioning projects , the original sweatshirts threw up some extra challenges . One of the sweatshirts had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless . I used the good back panel from the sweatshirt to cut the dress 's front piece and opened up one pair of sleeves to cut out the dress 's back piece , forming a seam along the Centre Back . <h> Wednesday , 7 November 2012 <p> I 'm guessing the last time you saw some images of NYC , the ground was covered with water and bits of tree were in places you would n't normally expect to find them . It has been crazy to see the wreckage brought by super-storm Sandy on the place we were honeymooning in just a month before and I feel awful for everyone who has suffered because of it . That said , I know that some of my lovely readers would like to hear a bit about how our honeymoon went , so here we go ... <p> We spent a week in total in NYC , spending two nights in a hotel in midtown Manhattan and the other five nights in an apartment in Williamsburg , Brooklyn , that we rented via air bnb . Oh my goodness we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting , and we walked about seeing , eating and drinking as much as we physically could ! <p> During the first couple of days , whilst dealing with our jet lag , we put ourselves on those open-top tourist buses which gave us a fantastic over view of Manhattan and helped us to decide which parts of it we wanted to head back to and explore more thoroughly . Our criteria for ' places we 'd like to head back to and explore more thoroughly ' basically involves interesting , old architecture with fantastic looking cafes and bars . Using this criteria we found our way back to Greenwich Village , the East Village and the Lower East Side . <p> Whilst we were in Manhattan , it may not surprise you to learn that we headed to the Garment District . Thanks everyone who made suggestions of where is worth going , all your suggestions were very helpful . I could easily have spent a whole day going to each location , but I was very aware that it was Pat 's honeymoon too , and I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and notion shops , no matter how many book stores I took him to in return . <p> Seeing as I was n't messing around , I went straight to Mood fabrics . Thanks very much to the ladies that explained how to find the entrance ! No obvious to the uninitiated , eh ? ! I ran round that place like a game show contestant , trying to see every single section . Notice the mild panic in my expression in the picture above as I desperately try to see every damn roll of fabric . Just because I do n't tend to buy new fabric and try to stash-bust instead , does n't mean that I do n't want to gaze at it all ! As I mentioned in my previous post , I had decided that I would allow myself to buy some fabric if I fell in love with some . <p> I was on the look out for some red , mustard or jade stretch denim type trouser fabric , but nothing there seemed quite right . I did , however , buy one yard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was $25 a yard , so although a pair of trousers in it would be epically awesome , I think I 'll have to settle for making a high waisted pencil skirt ! <p> I also visited a couple of notions shops , but there really is only so many anchor buttons a girl can own so I walked away empty handed from those . I did also visit Metro Textiles , another well hidden fabric cave owned by the inimitable Mr Kashi . Check out Erica B ' s amusing video to see this master salesman at work . As some people have noted , if you do n't like very attentive salesmen , this shop might not be for you . I was able to deflect his attentions onto a couple of Canadian students and viewed his Aladdin 's cave in peace . There are probably some awesome bargains to be found in there , but nothing particularly caught my eye . <p> I also walked in and then out of Spandex House . Once again , I 'm sure there are bargains to be found in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the front of the shop , and a cupboard full of jersey already in my flat , I did n't feel it was worth spending valuable time there when Happy Hour was fast approaching . Another shop , away from the Garment District in the Lower East Side opposite the Tenement Museum was a predominantly upholstery fabric outlet called Joey 's ( or something ) which seemed like bargains lay within ( see above ) . As we 've previously discussed , at the end of the day who 's to say what is curtaining and what is dress/coat/skirt fabric anyways ? ! <p> The Tenement Museum , incidentally , was incredibly interesting and I 'd definitely recommend their Sweat Shop tour for learning about both how the immigrant population lived and how clothing used to be produced . It was really eye-opening and I felt super pleased we went on it . <p> Also in Manhattan , we were very lucky to spend an evening with the very lovely and gorgeous sewing blogger Janice from She 's In Fashion ( pictured above ) . It was great to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident lots of the questions Pat and I had by then racked up ! And who would have guessed it , Janice practises martial arts so the conversation switched regularly between ninja stuff and sewing ! <p> In terms of creative stuff , I could talk more about the inspirational markets , fairs , shops and so on we found in Manhattan and Brooklyn , but I could equally expand upon the epic Mexican food , Moritos ( frozen Margarita and Mojito blends ! Seriously Karen , that 's a thing ! ) , crack pie and so on that we experienced . Instead , I 'll share a few extra little nuggets from out trip . <p> A chicken caesar salad on a pizza ! It was hot but somehow the lettuce was still crunchy . I do n't claim to understand science . <p> Somehow , as big as this flea market store was , there was n't one thing I wanted in here . Weird . <p> Inspiration for my Autumn/Winter wardrobe . <p> Whilst we were drinking our coffees , a woman sitting close by announced loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We stayed there for ages longer that we otherwise would have . <p> Moritos ! ! ! It took me a couple of these to realise I would have been happier with a straight up Margarita , the fake mint flavour was dragging it down . <p> Drunken boy ! ! ! Very cute . <p> Basically a warehouse full of Mad Men era furniture . I nearly wept . <p> A Homage to Saint Chihuahua . I assume . <p> Brooklyn Bridge ! Sunshine ! Hurrah ! <p> Pat could easily have moved in to this Mexican restaurant/bar . I 'm lucky he finally chose to come back to UK with me . <p> These croissants do n't look as big in this picture as they were in real life . They were more the size of a new-born infant . They could sustain a girl for days . Or at least until the next lovely cafe/bar/restaurant . <p> Street Art ! Boom ! Did I mention that we saw TWO street art books that Pat has written for sale in New York book shops ? No ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bunch of time ago I made a range of cute skirts to sell . First I tried to sell them on a market stall in London , with little success . Then I tried to sell them on Etsy , also with little success but I did nothing to promote or re-list them so that was not very surprising . Then when I started to organise a Brighton-based craft market , I sold some of them there . And finally I stocked the remainder in the awesome Handmade Co-op shop in Brighton ( RIP ) with much more success . Hurrah ! <p> Right now our little one bedroom flat is stuffed to the gunnels with ( my ) stuff and I 've been having a hunt for items that can be given a new home . During this hunt I found the final few pieces from my skirt range and thought maybes some of my lovely blog readers would like them , rather than stuffing them back in the cupboard ! <p> Today 's giveaway is for the final two Rockabilly Swallow A-line mini-skirts . I 've got one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in : a rich , tomato-y red and a dove grey . Both are a ' Medium ' , but in reality that 's pretty freakin ' small . <p> The waists measure 33.5 " , so if the level you like to wear your skirts at measures a bit smaller than that , then these should fit you ( or whoever you 'd like to give one of these to ) just fine . They measure 13 " from waistline to hem , pretty damn short ! <p> They are made from a poly-cotton blend and have contrast cotton gingham facings . They fasten with a concealed side zip . The swallows are leather appliqus , I 'd recommend a gentle hand wash in case the leather dye leaks . Some of these skirts have been washed many many times with no problems , but a couple have released dye when machine-washed . What can I say ? You 're getting these for free ! <p> To enter the giveaway to get one of these skirts , just leave a comment in the comments section of this post telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it if you won ( e.g , you 'd give it to a loved one ; you 'd wear it with some killer platforms , etc ... not for any particular reason , I 'm just nosey ) . If I ca n't access your email address within two clicks , please include it in your entry comment . Email addresses will not be used for anything other than to contact you if you are one of the two lucky winners of this giveaway . This giveaway is open internationally and the winners will receive the skirt completely free of charge . The giveaway entries will close at midnight GMT Sunday 11th November and the winners will be chosen by random number generator and contacted Monday 12th November October . Good luck , my skirt-wearing friends ! <h> Friday , 2 November 2012 <p> Today I present to you a pretty revamp of an old unwanted mens grey marl T-shirt . Using a smallish piece of lace , I created soft puffy sleeves and a heart cut-out back detail . The original grey T-shirt was one of those super-soft ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimes well with this girly refashion . <p> Using a self-drafted T-shirt block , I added a scoop neck line which I bound in a strip of the jersey I made from the removed sleeves . The puffy sleeves have a cuff made from more strips of sleeve . The shoulders and upper arms are visible through the sheer lace , but still kind of obscured . This T-shirt was n't made for me , but as a woman with largish upper arms , I like sleeves that slightly obscure but not completely hide this area of the body . <p> The heart cut-out is created using reverse appliqu . The lace heart-shaped panel was pinned to the wrong side of the back garment piece . I then stitched two rows of straight stitch close together around the heart shape and carefully cut away the grey jersey from the inside of the stitching , mindful not to snip the lace as I went . <h> Wednesday , 31 October 2012 <p> I am excited to be able to say that I now have two classes at Super+Super HQ under my belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Introduction to Commercial Sewing Patterns Class . Both went really well and I met some super-lovely ladies who thankfully gave very positive feedback on their experience of each ( hurrah ! ) . My goodness I love teaching sewing stuff ! I do n't think there is any kind of occupation that I could enjoy more ( they still have n't made Wine-Drinker a proper job yet , have they ? ) . <p> I 'd like to let you know about the next dates you could take part in these two classes . Both take place in November at the same location , Super+Super HQ in central Brighton , UK . <p> Class : Introduction to Commercial Sewing Patterns <p> When : Sunday 18th November , 10.30am - 1.00pm <p> Cost : 24.50 <p> This session will designed to demystify and explain how to use commercial sewing patterns . This is a discussion and demonstration based class , not a practical ' doing ' one . Topics covered will include : <p> What to do if your measurements span two or more sizes on the pattern <p> What to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been designed for <p> What the differences between vintage and modern patterns are <p> How to select appropriate fabric for your pattern <p> What all the symbols on the pattern mean and what to do about them <p> And lots more . The perfect class for a Sunday morning with a tea or coffee in hand . <p> Will need to bring : Nothing accept a notebook and pen if you wish to make extra notes . <p> Recommended for : This class is perfect for someone who has already taken a beginners sewing class or generally feels ok using a sewing machine , and now wants to amp their skills to become a confident dress-maker . <p> This session will take you through the process of making your own vest from jersey fabric or unwanted T-shirts . Using my multi-sized vest pattern , we will go slowly through the steps from pattern preparation and cutting out the pieces , to construction using a sewing machine and overlocker/serger ( no previous overlocker/serger experience necessary ) . By the end of this class , not only will you have a wearable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also have been provided with the skills and pattern you 'll need to make hundreds more vests in the future . <p> Will need to bring : 1 metre of jersey and/or some large unwanted T-shirts . Everything else will be available at the class . <p> Recommended for : All skill levels are welcome , but must have used a sewing machine before and feel relatively confident doing so . This class is ideal for someone interested in 
##211550 <h> United Rentals ' 7% Jump - A Long no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article . ( More ... ) <p> United Rentals ( URI ) jumped 7.6% on Sept. 4 , 2012 , from the previous day 's close of $32.31 to day 's high of $34.65 , before settling to the day 's close of $34.42 . <p> The knee jerk reaction on the stock price was probably because of the earlier news that the rating agency Standard &; Poors raised the company 's credit rating a notch and said that it has improved its operating performance and credit measures . <p> A Year 's Following <p> I have owned United Rentals ' stock since August 2011 , when the price bottomed at $14.87 , and it has always been an extremely volatile component in my portfolio . Ten percent swings are not uncommon for this stock . On June 21 , 2012 , I had discussed a comprehensive list of catalysts that could potentially result in United Rentals ' outperformance in 2012 and 2013 . An excerpt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy URI ? I believe , over time . <p> URI 's beta is 2.47 , and it easily swings 10% both ways in a week 's time . With the Fed 's latest Twist , the market might be heading towards choppy trading , treading waters for next few weeks or going lower , causing good entry points for investors . After this 8%+ slide , investors should not panic . For new investors , this is the time to start nibbling on URI , instead of taking a huge bite . <p> Source : " Top 12 Reasons URI Must Be On Your Summer Shopping List " <p> Why URI 's operating performance matters <p> In response to the June article , a gentleman had rightfully raised the point in the comments section that the Debt/Equity ratio for the company is high , and that if it " sneezed , it 'd lose it all . " My rebuttal in the comments was the following : <p> Total debt/total capital is 97% , agreed , but the industry average is high already at 75% . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lose quite a bit if not all " , but the company did reduce the percentage of debt used in its capital structure this year which is encouraging . <p> Operating performance for a company that is this highly leveraged is very important in this economy . United Rentals ' free cash flow is negative and is expected to remain negative for the remainder of the 2012 . L ooking at the Interest Coverage and Quick Ratios of the company , there is a risk for investors that the company could face trouble servicing its debt ( if the market sees rental rate declines ) , considering that its operating profits or current assets alone are not high enough to satisfy its interest obligations . <p> Apart from the overall sluggish recovery in the U.S. ( note that United Rentals operates in U.S . and Canada only , so there is no business impact due to the recessions in Europe ) , this was one reason why , in spite of an extremely high TTM EPS growth , the company 's stock kept wobbling up and down without conviction even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a rating agency like Standard &; Poor 's raised the company 's rating from B to B+ on Tuesday and stated that the " outlook is stable , " traders jumped in to make hay . <p> Catalysts Still In Play <p> The 12 catalysts discussed in the June article are very much still in play . The July earnings showed that the company swung to a loss due to the RSC Holdings acquisition , but revenue jumped 58% and more importantly , the margins improved considerably . <p> The two most important catalysts that will continue to propel this stock for the next six quarters or so are the following : <p> Equipment rental rates ( 7% increase in 2012 ) and utilization rates have improved in 2012 and the trend has remained positive since 2010 and is expected to continue into 2013 . Increased rental rates contribute the United Rentals ' revenues as well as margins , especially when the company is working hard in cutting its costs . <p> The b usiness c ycle is another reason why United Rentals is the right investment in the Industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking economic conditions are forced to rent rather than own the equipment . <p> Even if the economic recovery speeds up unexpectedly , there are additional advantages for stakeholders to continue renting the equipment versus buying . In a high speed economic recovery scenario , one would prefer to use capital investments for growth purposes rather than cutting costs on rentals , especially because they usually need many types of equipments and buying all the required equipments could damage rather than help their balance sheets . <p> United Rentals is thus well positioned to gain in either scenario . <p> Other Positives <p> Apart from the above mentioned fundamental factors , there are other positives that investors should take note of . <p> As shown below , the company has given positive EPS surprises consistently since 2011 . <p> Revenues are expected to rise substantially from 2011 levels until 2014 . In the chart below , the 2011 numbers are actuals and the numbers for years 2012-2014 are estimates . <p> In July 2012 , United Rentals announced pro forma financial guidance for the second half of 2012 . The company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EBITDA margins improving by 5% from 40% in the first half to 45% in the second . It also stated an expected 6.5% year over year increase in the rental rates and an improved utilization rate of 68% . <p> Construction activity has bottomed in the United States and is expected to pick up from here . This bodes well for United Rentals as increased activity in the commercial construction and industrial space will bring higher revenues for the company . <p> With the RSC Holdings acquisition , the company 's fleet now contains a broader selection of equipment and has added flexibility to meet high demand , making United Rentals an 800 pound gorilla in the equipment rental domain . <p> The company has made successful attempts of improving its balance sheet , by improving the Debt/Total Capital ratio from 97% to 83% , bringing it much closer to the industry average of 75% . <p> Conclusion <p> In July 2012 , analysts at Credit Suisse had raised the target price for United Rentals to $47 , close to its 52 week highs . At $47 , the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 EPS estimate of $4.63 . If the company keeps giving positive EPS surprises as it has in the past many quarters , taking into account the highest estimated EPS of $5.02 , the stock could trade well above $50 in the next 12-18 months . <p> Risks <p> As with any other investments , there are risks associated with investing in URI . <p> Utilization rates have improved slightly in 2012 , but if this trend discontinues , investors should start getting cautious . <p> Further slowdown in the economic recovery in the United States could result in a delayed increase in industrial and construction activity , making the stock out of favor for investors . <p> As discussed above , increasing rental rates are an important catalyst for URI .

##213052 <p> Annoyed by meddling journalists and their questions about poor performances in the Champions League job prospects at Monaco , Man City manager Roberto Mancini sent first-team coach David Platt to do his press conference duties before and after last weekend 's match against Spurs . This week , Mancini actually did show up for his date with the press ahead of Saturday 's game against Aston Villa , but he first appeared behind a terrifyingly delightful David Platt mask . <p> One by one , the assembled reporters gave it a hearty chuckle ( something that requires a lot of effort from them ) and Mancini asked them , " Do you want David or me ? " Sadly , no one had the guts to say " Mario Balotelli . " <p> The shirt sponsorship bait and switch pulled by the Qatar Sports Investment and FC Barcelona is finally complete as Qatar Airways becomes the new shirt sponsor of the club that used to famously shun corporate shirt sponsors to benefit charitable organizations . <p> When Barcelona signed the richest shirt sponsorship deal of all-time ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation last year , the was considerable outrage that the UNICEF logo , which the club has paid to wear for many years , would be relegated to the back of the shirt . This was compounded by concern over Qatar 's human rights record and the mystery as to why a foundation that aims to improve education , science and community development within Qatar would sponsor a Spanish club . But the sponsor on the shirt would still have the word " foundation " in it , so surely it must be something of a good cause , it was reasoned . <p> Well , now the " Qatar " is being kept , but the " Foundation " is being replaced with " Airways " as it <p> Like the Commission meeting in The Godfather , representatives from every Premier League club met in London on Thursday to discuss the possibility of implementing UEFA 's Financial Fair Play rules . Though nothing was decided , according to ESPN several other proposals were made at this meeting on everything from player contract guarantees to a vote to gauge support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Man City were one of only four clubs that voted against this ) . The following is a transcript of the meeting . <p> Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore : Gentlemen , thank you for coming today . With every club represented here , I believe we can make tremendous progress towards a bright and financially stable future . I look forward to hearing all of your ideas and proposals- <p> Arsene Wenger : I propose we ban everyone from spending any money . <p> Scudamore : Now , Arsene , you say this every time but I do n't think- <p> Sheikh Mansour : I propose that all clubs be required to spend a minimum of 1 billion a year . <p> Roman Abramovich covers his mouth and whispers to Juan Mata <p> Mata : Mr. Abramovich says he seconds this motion . He also proposes that all owners be required to have at least three luxury yachts as a show of good faith . <p> After his brilliant fourth goal against England , for the first time ever , the overwhelming praise Zlatan Ibrahimovic heard outside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside his head . But that has n't stopped Zlatan from helping out his teammates and the good causes they champion . <p> Since Zlatan does not need his boots to execute footballing perfection , he gave the pair he wore in his destruction of England to Sweden teammate Jonas Olsson so Olsson can give them away to one lucky person , picked at random , who donates money to help care for premature babies . Yes , before they become religious artifacts to Zlatanists of the future , they can , potentially , be yours . <p> The fight for Catalonian independence may have taken a serious blow this week as the Catalonia Football Federation revealed a brand-new strip which is , well ... just look at it . <p> The new shirts -- designed by renowned designer of fashionable things Custo Dalmau -- are said to be inspired by the fire of the dragon that was slain by Saint George , the patron saint of Catalonia . However , they look more like someone committed a massacre in a fishpond . Possibly Pepe . <p> La Selecci Catalana head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which have been manufactured by Spanish sportswear brand Astore ( whose website contains a superbly translated tale about the bird of prey which inspires their logo ) . By all accounts , it 's a step down in aesthetic quality from their previous strip . <p> Argentine striker Gaston Cellerino was sent off near the end of a Chilean Primera Division match between his Union La Calera side and Wanderers after receiving his second yellow card . As he trudged off the pitch , opposing goalkeeper Mauricio Viana got a bit too close and Cellerino brushed him away , prompting Viana to drop the ground like he was hurt . <p> A brief standoff between Cellerino and another Wanderers player ensued , but when Viana rushed back into it , Cellerino decided he had had enough and unleashed a wicked kung-fu kick to his chest . Viana was out for the count and Cellerino was dragged off , surely for the last time he will see a pitch for a long while . Nigel De Jong has nothing on him , but Eric Cantona will probably send him a fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Day : a chronicling of unfortunate events . <p> Fans throwing explosives at footballers seems to be a developing trend happening in all different parts of the world . First , there was the Asian Champions League incident in September where a player from Iranian club Sepahan tossed what he did n't know was an explosive thrown by fans of Saudi club Al-Ahli just before it exploded . Then just a few weeks ago in Cyprus , fans threw an explosive directly at a player receiving treatment for an injury . And now , fans of Argentine club Independiente have copied the idea by throwing firecrackers of their own at Belgrano goalkeeper Juan Olave . <p> The incident occurred during a restart in play with Belgrano up 1-0 after scoring in the 41st minute . An explosive appeared to be thrown from the section behind Olave 's goal and landed near the unsuspecting keeper with a tail of white smoke . When it loudly went off next to him , Olave went down covering his ears next to the cloud of smoke . His teammates <p> Since Eric Cantona abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just five season with Manchester United , there has been an Eric Cantona sized hole in the Premier League ( and , sadly , there has not been a Cantona sized hole in the chests of some Premier League fans ) . But there is hope of filling that hole with an older , more bearded Cantona ! <p> Between acting in movies and doing not that much in his role as " director of soccer " for the re-reborn New York Cosmos as they prepare for their inaugural season in the U.S. second division next year , Cantona is apparently open to new offers . So when ESPN asked if he would want to manage his former club , he was responsive . <p> The youthful inconsistency of Neymar was on full display in Brazil 's 1-1 draw against Colombia . The 20-year-old Ballon d'Or nominee equalized for Brazil with a typically wonderful run into the box and between a couple of defenders ( video below ) , but when he had the chance at what could have been a winner from the penalty spot in the 81st minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission control at NASA . <p> The penalty is being compared to Sergio Ramos ' effort in Real Madrid 's Champions League shootout against Bayern Munich last season , but Neymar 's might have topped it . Of course , Neymar 's came in a meaningless friendly and not the semifinals of the Champions 
##217252 <p> New York State 's road to recovery from Superstorm Sandy will run through Forest Hills . <p> The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) will be coordinating all relief efforts out of JetBlue 's former headquarters in the Forest Hills Tower , officials told the Daily News on Monday . <p> FEMA employees and officials with responders such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Coast Guard have begun moving into the state 's joint field office , toting large bags and portable work stations . <p> " This will be the hub in terms of the recovery from Sandy , " said agency spokesman Bill Rukeyser . " We are used to the idea of having to set up a quite complex operation on short notice . " <p> The proximity to both public transportation and several highways was ideal for FEMA 's relief efforts in the area , which may take roughly a year to complete , Rukeyser said . <p> " In previous disasters that I 've worked , it 's been at least months and those disasters were smaller than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest one that I 've ever worked on .

##217752 <h> Community <h> Does This Coroutine Make Sense ? <p> 0 <p> I 'm new to the concept of coroutines . Within one of my scripts I check to see if a variety of different objects are close enough to the camera to enable them . If they are not , they remain disabled . The script checks the distances every X seconds . <p> I was noticing within Profiler that the script was taking about 2.5ms-3.5ms to process and would like to cut it down , so I modified my code ( below ) . <p> Can anyone tell me if doing it this way is a good idea or not ? I guess I 'm specifically referring to the way the conditional statements " yield " within CheckShowOrDontShow() . From what I understand , yield will basically exit the coroutine , then next frame return to where it left off . The result is that the Profiler shows it as taking 0.15ms-0.3ms now . Great ! Just not sure if I 'm missing something or causing problems elsewhere . <p> That 's a great use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea . <p> I would suggest that you square visibleDistance at the start and then check ( cachedPlayerPosition - theLocationi ) . sqrMagnitude because square roots are recursive and expensive .

##230850 <p> Stuffed squash is a great meatless option for a Thanksgiving or holiday meal , especially if you 're looking for something a little outside the traditional norm ! The quinoa stuffed squash we made last year was such a hit , we decided to do another take on it this year . Instead of stuffing the squash with quinoa , we decided to go with a traditional bread stuffing , made with whole grain bread , leeks , and herbs .

I was immediately drawn to the purple , with its exotic bright color . As much as we love roasted cauliflower , we could n't wait to try something with this beautiful variant . My first thought was a risotto , that wonderful , creamy traditional Italian rice dish . You can add just about any type of vegetable to the rice , so we thought we 'd try cauliflower . Our first attempt did n't work quite as intended , so we decided to try again

##236752 <p> That is one of the questions currently being discussed in the U.S. History to 1865 class that I am taking . The vast majority of the class feels that states do not have the right to secede under any circumstances . That makes me sad . When the majority of the population of any geographic area is no longer being served by the dominant government , then citizens not only have a right to secede , they have a moral obligation to do so . <p> There are two major facets to the secession question : 1 ) morality and 2 ) self-interest . These two items do not necessarily align with one another . When the U.S. Civil War began , the rationale for war on both sides was highly complicated . The North entered the war for two primary reasons : 1 ) Keeping the Union from dissolving by force and 2 ) forcing the issue of slavery . The first reason was immoral and the second was moral . Yet the first reason was Abraham Lincoln 's primary reason for using force to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was morally wrong , but he did not declare war because of slavery . He declared war because he believed the federal government should be the highest authority in the land , and that states had no right to self-determination . Abolition was not his primary goal . Lincoln himself said this : <p> I will say then that I am not , nor ever have been , in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races -- that I am not , nor ever have been , in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes , nor of qualifying them to hold office , nor to intermarry with white people ; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality . And in as much as they can not so live , while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior , and I as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior position assigned to the white race . <p> Some Southerners , to be sure , fought in the Civil War to preserve the immoral institution of human slavery , but many enlisted in the war effort because they felt that the North was trying to dictate how they should live . <p> The outcome of the Civil War was never really in doubt . The North had vast superiority in numbers and had the industrial base . Technology is amoral , and the North held the technology -- it was therefore destined for victory . While the end of the war settled the question of slavery , it did not grant equality to blacks . That issue would not be settled for another one hundred years , when the Civil Rights movement of the 1960 ? s forced Americans to reexamine racial inequalities in their society . <p> What the Civil War did accomplish was the growth of government , and the mitigation of liberty for all American citizens and residents . From the end of the war until the present day , the Federal government 's role in decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large segment of the American population is completely or partially dependent on theft by taxes for its well-being . <p> Back to the original question , though ! Do states have a right to secede ? What circumstances , if any , justify a declaration that a state no longer wishes to be a part of the union called the United States of America ? <h> About the Author <p> Trevor I am a 41-year-old Georgia National Guardsman who served in Iraq from 2005-2006 .

I went to school in several states , and the spiel I always got was : 1 ) the South seceded to protect its states ' rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states ) started the Civil War , 3 ) the federal government eventually broke the back of the Confederate Army and destroyed much of the south 's social and economic institutions in the process , and 4 ) after the war , slavery was abolished . If something different is being taught today , I 'd be interested to see the texts espousing such a view ( please note that anecdotes that start with " I have a friend " or " my cousin " are n't helpful ) . In any event , the issue of the " right " to secede is largely a rhetorical one ( along the lines of " if we were to fight the Civil War today , who would win ? " ) . The Constitution simply does n't address the issue . <p> The common interpretation of the Constitution is that the federal government is one of enumerated powers ... that is , it has the powers explicitly set out in the Constitution . The 10th Amendment says everything else goes to the states . Someone above said that amendment was " tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not true -- the Supreme Court regularly invokes the 10th Amendment , stating that a wide variety of issues are controlled by state , not federal , law and principles . Anyway , history seems to show that the drafters of the Constitution thought of the Constitution as somewhat of an experiment , and that several states expressed reservations about making the Constitution " permanent " -- they wanted to be able to leave if it did n't work out . In a nutshell , that 's your " legal " case for secession . <p> The case against it ? Strict constructionists like Nino Scalia and Clarence Thomas would tell you what the states and the drafters thought at the time was irrelevant . Their intent is meaningless -- you have to look at the wording of the Constitution , and that 's it . Using that as a standard , one would have to have a very vivid imagination to find something in the 10th Amendment granting a " right " to not adhere to the Constitution . After all , the entire Bill of Rights describes rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a whole lot of sense to say you can dictate all these rights ( to the people ) on one hand , and then let state governments choose to ignore all of them on the other . <p> I suppose reasonable minds can differ on how that debate should come out . Lord knows enough ink has been spilled over the issue . But the reality is this : the composition of a state or country or whatever is a political issue . And what is " legal " when it comes to political issues like this is irrelevant . I mean , just where would one go to get a ruling on such a " right ? " The International Criminal Court ? ( We are n't members ) The U.N. ? ( not likely ) Some county court in Kansas ? <p> This is the quintessential Marbury v. Madison question : who will enforce this " right ? " The answer , in this case , is : nobody -- the issue will be decided politically . And remember that Sun Tzu accurately pointed out that war is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger state either allows it peacefully ( think Hungary ) or goes to war over it ( think Kurds in Iraq ) . Is it " legal ? " Was going to war in Korea legal ? Vietnam ? Iraq ? Does it matter to anyone but academic head-scratchers ? No , it does n't . If South Dakota decides to secede , no one will ever care if they have a legal right to do so -- the issue will be whether or not the federal government launches a war to suppress the revolution , and , if so , who wins the fight . It is n't like some judge is going to issue a ruling on the legality of it all . And even if some judge did , no one would really expect anyone to actually listen to that judge ( just look at the controversy around most of our Supreme Court decisions ) . It all comes down to whether a political agreement is brokered or the decision is made through a contest of force . If South Dakota wins , the nation becomes one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to business as usual ( that is , we debate the " legality " of it all ... even though the debate is irrelevant for all intents and purposes ... for the next 200 years ) . <p> The South seceded ( legally or otherwise ) and the North imposed its will by force ( legally or otherwise ) . We can debate the merits of that until the cows come home , but as I implied above : that 's nothing more than junior high debate-team fodder . I mean , what if Katrina had n't broke the levees ? What if Chamberlain 's appeasement worked ? What if we won the Korean War ? Was there an international legal principle justifying apartheid ? <p> Who cares . <p> You can only dissect these issues so far . In the end , it just does n't matter . The Confederacy was wiped out more than a century ago , we do n't have slavery anymore , we are n't part of England , no state is even discussing the possibility of seceding ( cut off those highway $$$ ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 2 hours worth of discussion in any high schoolers ' education . Yes , a lot of people died , but it 's over . It 's done . The southerners are the biggest " proudtobeanAmerican " flag wavers we 've got in this country .

The airmen guarding the silos are just as likely from New York and Vermont as they are from Alabama , so you ca n't really expect them to just throw down their guns and say , " Heck , ya ! I wan na secede ! " Remember they 're being paid by the feds ... <p> And for Bryan , above : The kid is yours , and you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support and quit bellyaching about it .

If something different is being taught today , I 'd be interested to see the texts espousing such a view ( please note that anecdotes that start with " I have a friend " or " my cousin " are n't helpful ) . In any event , the issue of the " right " to secede is largely a rhetorical one ( along the lines of " if we were to fight the Civil War today , who would win ? " ) . The Constitution simply does n't address the issue . <p> The common interpretation of the Constitution is that the federal government is one of enumerated powers ... that is , it has the powers explicitly set out in the Constitution . The 10th Amendment says everything else goes to the states . Someone above said that amendment was " tossed out the window " in the 1930s , but that 's not true -- the Supreme Court regularly invokes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are controlled by state , not federal , law and principles . Anyway , history seems to show that the drafters of the Constitution thought of the Constitution as somewhat of an experiment , and that several states expressed reservations about making the Constitution " permanent " -- they wanted to be able to leave if it did n't work out . In a nutshell , that 's your " legal " case for secession . <p> The case against it ? Strict constructionists like Nino Scalia and Clarence Thomas would tell you what the states and the drafters thought at the time was irrelevant . Their intent is meaningless -- you have to look at the wording of the Constitution , and that 's it . Using that as a standard , one would have to have a very vivid imagination to find something in the 10th Amendment granting a " right " to not adhere to the Constitution . After all , the entire Bill of Rights describes rights that must be afforded to people -- it does n't make a whole lot of sense to say you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , and then let state governments choose to ignore all of them on the other . <p> I suppose reasonable minds can differ on how that debate should come out . Lord knows enough ink has been spilled over the issue . But the reality is this : the composition of a state or country or whatever is a political issue . And what is " legal " when it comes to political issues like this is irrelevant . I mean , just where would one go to get a ruling on such a " right ? " The International Criminal Court ? ( We are n't members ) The U.N. ? ( not likely ) Some county court in Kansas ? <p> This is the quintessential Marbury v. Madison question : who will enforce this " right ? " The answer , in this case , is : nobody -- the issue will be decided politically . And remember that Sun Tzu accurately pointed out that war is politics by other means . A state secedes and the larger state either allows it peacefully ( think Hungary ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq ) . Is it " legal ? " Was going to war in Korea legal ? Vietnam ? Iraq ? Does it matter to anyone but academic head-scratchers ? No , it does n't . If South Dakota decides to secede , no one will ever care if they have a legal right to do so -- the issue will be whether or not the federal government launches a war to suppress the revolution , and , if so , who wins the fight . It is n't like some judge is going to issue a ruling on the legality of it all . And even if some judge did , no one would really expect anyone to actually listen to that judge ( just look at the controversy around most of our Supreme Court decisions ) . It all comes down to whether a political agreement is brokered or the decision is made through a contest of force . If South Dakota wins , the nation becomes one of 49 states . If the state loses , we go back to business as usual ( that is , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the debate is irrelevant for all intents and purposes ... for the next 200 years ) . <p> The South seceded ( legally or otherwise ) and the North imposed its will by force ( legally or otherwise ) . We can debate the merits of that until the cows come home , but as I implied above : that 's nothing more than junior high debate-team fodder . I mean , what if Katrina had n't broke the levees ? What if Chamberlain 's appeasement worked ? What if we won the Korean War ? Was there an international legal principle justifying apartheid ? <p> Who cares . <p> You can only dissect these issues so far . In the end , it just does n't matter . The Confederacy was wiped out more than a century ago , we do n't have slavery anymore , we are n't part of England , no state is even discussing the possibility of seceding ( cut off those highway $$$ ? no way ! ) , and the Civil War gets about 2 hours worth of discussion in any high schoolers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's over . It 's done . The southerners are the biggest " proudtobeanAmerican " flag wavers we 've got in this country . It 's time to just get over it and move on . <p> <p> I do have to note that the states probably would n't get much use out of the nuclear weapons on their soil -- the folks guarding them are federal troops , only the feds have the launch codes , and ( assuming the state respects the rule of law ) those bases are on exclusive federal jurisdiction property . The airmen guarding the silos are just as likely from New York and Vermont as they are from Alabama , so you ca n't really expect them to just throw down their guns and say , " Heck , ya ! I wan na secede ! " Remember they 're being paid by the feds ... <p> And for Bryan , above : The kid is yours , and you have a responsibility to care for him/her . Pay your child support and quit bellyaching about it . If you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have used a condom . I highly doubt you 'll get any support from the former Confederate states on this issue , because having -- and supporting -- a kid is all about ( hello ) personal responsibility . <p> Yoshi99 <p> That reference to Sun Tzu should be Karl Clausewitz . Sorry . <p> Yoshi99 <p> That reference to Sun Tzu should be Karl Clausewitz . Sorry . <p> PDXRover <p> Here 's my 2 cents on the issue . The decision of the North to not allow secession was not a matter of economics or some moral obligation to curtail slavery .

The southern states claimed that they had the right , since the " states " had created the Federal government , to overturn any federal law within their own borders if they disagreed with it .

Regardless of right or wrong , legal or illegal , allowing secession is a risky move ; the North just happened to come out on top .

Because that 's our fake freedom in the 21st century . <p> jackspratt <p> Pointless semantic argument . Look , the reality is this : 1 . The issue has been decided on the field . States are nothing more than administrative districts for DC 2 . The Supreme Court , who did n't touch the subject during the conflict , finally ruled in 1869 Texas v. White that there is no secession from the Union . Chief Justice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for treason for the very reason that the Federals did not want to risk losing in court what they won at war . Texas v. White followed Davis ' non-court case when he was imprisoned , without trial or charge , for years . 4 . If you think DC is letting the tax base leave , you are out of your mind . DC will roll troops on any state in a heartbeat if they think about it . " what about my tariff " ring a bell ? It should . That was what Lincoln said after SC said it would collect federal tariffs coming into Charleston after 20 DEC 1860. 5 . But no State ever will . Why ? They are all addicted to the Federal trough . <p> http : //trevorsnyder.com Trevor <p> Jack , <p> The nature of the universe is that nothing lasts forever . Your point 5 is therefore probably wrong . The federal system is n't good enough to last more than another 100 years at most . And the rate of social change and technology advancement almost guarantees the U.S. as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 50 years . That 's how I see it . <p> EmptySet <p> The 10th Amendment does not guarantee the right of a state to secede . Those who claim it does , always seem to neglect the last part of the Amendment : <p> " or to the people . " <p> The people clearly have a right to secede . You may wish at any time , to pack your bags and leave . Just like many other rights belong to the people , and not the States , the right to secede belongs to the citizens as individuals , and not the States . <p> http : //trevorsnyder.com Trevor <p> Is n't a state just a group of individuals ? If a strong majority of these vote to secede why should n't that be binding ? <p> notcrazy <p> Whether secession is legal or not is not really the issue . Our parents &; grandparent gave their lives in defence of our freedom . They gave everything ! The question really is am I willing to allow their sacrifices mean absolutely nothing ? If i approached you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that millions of people people have fought &; died for . It is so valuable my own grandfather gave 6 years of his life fighting for what is in this box . He finally won it through his sacrifice &; the sacrifice who his friends who lay dead because of the value of what i have in this box . I 'm thinking of throwing it away though , because I do n't really care enough for it to take the time time &; the effort it takes to sustain it . They did the hard work but it really is n't worth it to me to clean it &; make it shine anymore , no I think I 'll throw it away . Would you think I was crazy ? You would -- and anyone who will take the freedom that their faimilies have given their blood for is just as crazy . <p> tn1987 <p> Your missing the point though . If you said in this box is something my grandfather gave 6 years of his life to throw away would it be ok for me to throw this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor or who fought what . If you are going to support those who died to create this country then you must also support why they died to create this country and that is the Declaration . The right and freedom to leave one government and form another . THIS is the right by which they died to protect NOT the nation they were founding . The idea of freedom over government . That freedom should extend to allow states to leave . So to answer you , would I think your crazy maybe but ultimately it is YOUR right to throw it away in the first place and not mine to tell you what to do with it . <p> http : //willtoexist.com Trevor <p> I take it your conclusion is that state DO have the moral authority to secede then . <p> southron98 <p> Does n't ( I do n't know-but presume ) that Texas v. White , 74 U.S. 700 resolved that question and it is illegal to secede . <p> http : //willtoexist.com Trevor <p> Legality is irrelevant . It was illegal for the people who founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they did it anyway . <p> Thresamatthews <p> I know this is an old post , but as of Nov. 4 , 2010 , 66 counties in Texas have citizens in them calling for a citizens ' convention like they had in 1861 . <p> http : //willtoexist.com Trevor <p> Teresa , thanks for your input . Calling this an old post is a misnomer from a historical context -- the question of whether or not we are a free or forced union of states was not really settled permanently by our first and so far only civil war . <p> I have something to say about this . Every state the rights to secede from the Union . I am from California , if Texas seceded from the Union , I for one will join them . <p> Fed , you can read this and I have nothing hide my feeling and opinion . Robert White <p> Caldera19 <p> Saying that Lincoln " saved " the Union by winning the Civil War is like saying a man has saved his marriage by beating his wife into submission . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> http : //willtoexist.com Trevor <p> I 'll have to agree with you ! <p> Rich7544 <p> I suggest you read a book titled " BLOOD MONEY , The civil War and the Federal Reserve " written by John Remington Graham . There are instances that will reinforce the opinion the each state is soverign and as such , has the right to secede under certain situations and by following certain procedures held up for centuries . <p> PingEcho728 <p> I firmly believe it is the right of each individual State to decide whether , at any point in time and for any reason they want , to stay in the Union or to Secede from it . No where in the Constitution does it explictly or implictly say States must remain in the Union for all time . If one looks at the Constitution when the united states is mentioned spells it : united States of America . The founders believed , as do I , that the United States is a union of sovereign states joined together for common cause . It is not a suicide pact where every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the metaphorical cliff . Lincoln was a traitor to the Constitution as has every President from Lincoln onward with the possible exception of Ronald Reagan . Sic Semper Tyrannis . <p> Draygad <p> Two State Supreme Courts ruled that the secession of the Confederate States was both legal and justified . Ohio &; Maryland , both Union states by the way . One in 1861 , just prior to the beginning of the war , and another in 1865 , just after the end of the war . <p> http : **26;5366;TOOLONG R.H.F. <p> In my opinion you missed part of the real story regarding the Civil War . You said : " many enlisted in the war effort because they felt that the North was trying to dictate how they should live . " <p> The point you have overlooked was the Federalist insistence in increasing tax on property as a way to extort the products of the south . <p> The Federalists were upset because the south could sell cotton and its products at a higher profit to Europe and the north resented the high cost . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property ( also known as slaves ) to force them to concede to selling cotton cheaper . <p> You see ? It was not about slaves being free as in freedom but free as in a taxed commodity . <p> Back then MOST Southern people knew that slavery was nearing an end before the war to place . <p> FOR THE RECORD : the last place to officially re-join the Union after the war was a small town called Town Line -- they did the official documentation in 1946. .... oh -- Town Line is in Erie County New York . They Seceded because the Prisoners of War were poorly treated in NY State <p> Wildflamingoman <p> So , if a state should have the the right to secede , then an area within a city or an unincorporated area should also have the right to secede from the larger city and start it 's own town , right ? This happened in two relatively small and separate areas I lived in , in South Florida . Before you read on .......... answer the above question . <p> Ok , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be able to have your own little town if you want . Ok , then the next question is , for all the same reasons why some of you believe that a state should be able to secede ......... should n't a city or town or a group of cities or towns be able to form it's/their own state ? If the people in those towns/cities believe the state government is not governing in their best interest then they should have the right to secede from the state and govern themselves , just like a state should be able to secede from the country for those same reasons , right ? <p> So if we then follow that logic , then a relatively small area should legally be able and morally has the right to start it 's own town , then it 's own state and the it 's own country , or join some other union/country as some have suggested . And they , as free people , should be able to choose whichever union they want to join , right ? So some small area in Nebraska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of Pakistan or Iran or North Korea , like Alaska currently is a detached state of the US , right ? After all , people should be free to self determination , etc. , right ? <p> http : //willtoexist.com Trevor <p> I think it 's probably impractical for say , Chicago to secede and join Pakistan . The city of Dearborn , Michigan might want to secede and join an Arab state since the population is mostly Muslim . Morally and ethically people should be represented by those who share similar views . Practically though , I find it unlikely that any area of the United States is going to want to join Pakistan , North Korea or Iran . Those were silly examples . <p> Why did n't you use Canada or Mexico ? Let 's take the second example . If a border town votes to join Mexico , then yes , it should be allowed to do so . That would be moral . <p> http : **35;5394;TOOLONG Dean Robbins <p> I would n't be so sure about that statement -&gt; " I find it unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to join Pakistan , North Korea or Iran " The problem that we have is the electoral college and the winner takes all format . California has about 1/5 of the electoral college . So , one state is " dictating " to the rest of the country how it should " view " things . That is the core of the problem . Electoral votes should be based on sections within the state . If there are 55 districts in California , each district should be able to cast their vote for the candidate whom best serves their " views " . That would eliminate the " mob " rules scenarios that we are seeing play out . <p> Thenommonster <p> Alaska is n't a " detached state , " it 's non-contiguous , just like Hawaii .. <p> Racing9hd <p> same difference , lol <p> Wewe <p> Some mention of the constitution might be nice . <p> http : //willtoexist.com Trevor <p> Are you referring to the current Congress , or something else entirely ? I sure would like it if they followed the Constitution ... <p> Jrsimp61 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State of Emergency within the 48 contiguous states and places them all under martial , suspending all Constitutional rights of US citizens . Dispatching federal authorities to take over State Governments and deploying US or Foreign soldiers to the states to enforce Executive Orders . <p> http : **35;5431;TOOLONG Dean Robbins <p> God help us if that ever happens ! <p> Thenommonster <p> It 's not that States ' should be given the right to secede , secession plain and simply is something that should be frowned upon , and is . But in the case you described , that if government should fail to protect the rights ' of the people , then Constitutionally , the people have the right to overthrow government and start over , not necessarily just to secede . <p> Christian <p> To me the best analogy is whether an abused or neglected wife want to leave her husband and he uses force to make her stay ! Yeah -- viva Freedom ! ! United States is the biggest hypocrite nation to every exist ! Just like we are spreading freedom in the Middle East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repress their peoples . <p> torri girls <p> how about u go move ur ass to the middle east and then u will wish that u had appreciated living in the usa ! ! ! <p> Willy8512008 <p> The states do have a right to secede and I hope that the red states will take me with them . I am sick and tired of the federal government running our lives , confiscating our income and ignoring the constitution . The liberals feel they have a right to use my income to spread their generosity . They force their views on me and file lawsuits against mine . They want to force medical professionals to work for less , while they pay Amtrak employees far too much . I want a divorce from liberals and their lunacy . <p> torri girls <p> GREEDY AND SELFISH equals PRICK ! ! ! <p> Baseballeast4 <p> All I can say is after these next 4 years are up I 'll be proud to say I did not vote for him <p> torri girls <p> four yrs are just beginning so get used to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his VP is JOE BIDEN ; not MITT ROMNEY and PAUL RYAN ! ! ! <p> http : **30;5468;TOOLONG ? id=7 ... Emanuel Mandel <p> I love this article , I have a question however , what would happen to a state 's federal funding if they decide to secede ? <p> James <p> They would loose that federal funding BUT they would no longer be obligated to pay federal TAXES . Its a winning outcome for people like me in Florida or Texans that have no state income taxes ; but I 'd be willing to pay a bit more to my STATE in taxes where I know the money will be better spent . <p> Guitaristssweetheart <p> Actually , Lincoln was not opposed to slavery . Lincoln is placed on a pedestal and treated as a " god , " but he was anything but moral when it came to the blacks . Look at the history . Blacks were enlisting in the Confederacy but Grant had to beg to allow them into the Union army . In the South , they held rank ; but Lincoln made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white as long as I am in power . " The Union wrote the history of the war , but it does n't make it correct -- just like any war . Truth of the matter is that slavery was on its way out the door ; that with the invention of the cotton gin , there would be no need . If you dig deep enough you will find that the Union had to actually bribe former slaves to leave . I have read a testimony by one family who refused to leave because he considered his owners family . Other accounts have stated that the North treated blacks as 2nd class citizens . They were actually treated better in the south . Also , look up and read the CSA 's Constitution . It actually forbade the importation and exportation of slaves . One last thing , it was the North who introduced slavery into the US , while the southern state of VA was against it and tried to oppose it . The true reason behind the Civil war was the fact that the South had no representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone the right to seced from the Union and form their own Government . <p> Billc <p> Really ( redacted -- site owner does n't appreciate name calling ) what part of the constitution says that <p> http : //trevorsnyder.com Trevor <p> Try the Declaration of Independence Bill . Personally , I do n't need someone else 's permission to find my Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security . <p> Bonds held together by force do not equate to freedom , and responsible , free people do not have to stay in political bonds that do not benefit or appeal to them . Revolution the most basic human right , and the first step towards revolution is a partings of the political bonds that bind us to one another . Ideally the process happens peacefully . When people treat each other disrespectfully , as you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less likely as passion becomes inflamed . So calm down . <p> Starshine <p> Just as the Republicans were absolutely sure that they would win because they were surely the majority in this country , they also falsely believe that the majority of people in these states would agree to secede based on a small number of signatures on petitions gathered by sore and disgruntled losers . <p> No way any of these states could get a majority of citizens to vote for this ridiculous proposition . These tea party fanatics have signed over custody of their mental faculties to FAUX NEWS . I feel sorry for them as they have lost all sense of reality to the point where they are a danger to our country ................ <p> kymintjulips <p> While it may not be feasible to secede from the Union , MAYBE , if enough of THE PEOPLE let THEIR GOVERNMENT know how they feel about the condition THEIR GOVERNMENT has gotten their lives in with all of their over-bearing EPA regulations , government spending , foreign aid , just to mention a few , MAYBE the government officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they MAY start to do what is BEST for the nation 's citizens , instead of their PARTY and it 's views ! How can ANYONE be a danger to OUR country for SPEAKING OUT ? ? ? ? I do n't know about the rest of the country , but , in my area , THE PEOPLE feel as if the government has them backed into a wall with no way out .

No FAA to control your aircraft as if you would have any.This is just a ridiculously short list and the more I write the more I realize that you idiots are clueless , just like the people who voted for Romney in the first place who could n't have care less about 99% of the people who voted for him and now you morons have the gaul to suggest secession-good luck with that- I 'll be happily living in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA for the rest of my life and you people can feel free to move to HELL . <p> Seeker81041 <p> when a state became part of the united states they became part of the united states of there on free will an should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes to do so <p> http : //trevorsnyder.com Trevor <p> Tone down your rhetoric Bill .

He did n't give a damn about the slaves and even wrote letters to governors telling them that they could keep their slaves for another twenty years if they did n't secede . In certain parts of the north slavery was still legal and there were blacks who were slave masters themselves . Lincoln was a racist but actually Jefferson Davis was n't . He adopted a black child , submitted papers saying that he would never be a slave , gave him his name , sent him to school , and treated him like one of the family .

##253350 <h> Maldonado Trying to Get Latinos to Go Republican <p> In the Central Coast 's 24th Congressional District , incumbent Democrat Lois Capps is challenged by Republican Abel Maldonado . Here , both candidates are at a September debate sponsored by the San Luis Obispo Times . ( Photo : Scott Shafer ) <p> On the Central Coast , Republican Congressional candidate Abel Maldonado is hoping his Mexican heritage will help bridge that divide by appealing to Latinos and independent voters . Maldonado , a former lieutenant governor , is the kind of candidate the Republican Party covets these days . <p> " My father and mother came to this country with nothing , " Maldonado says . <p> He 's the oldest son of migrant workers -- Maldonado 's father came from Mexico in 1965 as a guest worker , eventually starting his own farm and growing it into a family business . <p> " The Republican Party has not done a good job of communicating with the fastest growing population in America , which happens to be Hispanics . " <p> At the age of 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit for a refrigerated warehouse on the farm , Maldonado was elected to the Santa Maria City Council . He rose to higher office , in the Assembly and Senate , and was eventually appointed lieutenant governor by Arnold Schwarzenegger when the office became vacant . <p> Maldonado lost his bid to remain Lieutenant Governor in an election against Gavin Newsom . But now he 's running in the 24 th Congressional District against incumbent Democrat Lois Capps . The newly drawn seat is much more competitive than it was before redistricting . It would seem tailor-made for a moderate Republican businessman like Maldonado . <p> But the " R " next to his name on the ballot could be a big liability , especially with Latinos , who make up nearly one in five voters in the district . " The Republican Party has not done a good job of communicating with the fastest growing population in America , which happens to be Hispanics , " Maldonado says . " You 're just committing political suicide . It 's just what it is . " <p> Maldonado 's home town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center for Employment Training ( CET ) there , Jessie Chavarria teaches computer skills to a full classroom . Most of the students are immigrants or children of immigrants . And Chavarria says many are simply disengaged from politics . <p> " Because they do n't see the election and the issues being about them , " Chavarria says . " They think it 's about something else , something that does n't really affect them . " But , Chavarria says , the election is all about them -- and their future . <p> " You know they need jobs , " Chavarria notes . " They need jobs to take care of themselves , take care of their families . To Improve their lot in life . Without that , what do they have ? " <p> Chavarria sees it as a vicious cycle -- young Latinos think politicians do n't speak to or care about them . So many of them do n't vote -- and are consequently ignored . <p> Down the hall , Jennifer Moran is training her students for jobs in medical fields . Moran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students to use them . <p> " We complain a lot throughout the terms that we did n't get this , we did n't get that , " Moran says . " Did ya vote ? ' No . ' How can you expect to get change if you 're not putting your change into it ? You put one grain of salt and that 's all you have , just a grain . Put a bunch of them and you have enough to start cooking , to start getting the pot stirred . " <p> The director of CET is Gabriel Morales . As a young man , Morales was a Democrat , but now he 's a registered Republican . He traces his conversion back to his faith -- and a time when he and others helped build some new churches in Santa Maria . <p> " It seemed that the people that reached out to us building those churches happened to be Republicans , " Morales remembers . " And then what happened is a lot of the churches I was involved in were Latino churches -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Morales will vote for Mitt Romney and probably Abel Maldonado . But he seems conflicted -- uncomfortable with a GOP that does n't always welcome minorities like him . <p> That hostility toward immigrants was evidenced by one shopper at the Thursday night Farmer 's Market in downtown San Luis Obispo . Evelyn Roth , a retired haircutter from Santa Maria , was quick to express her view about immigrants who she thinks ignores the melting pot . <p> " I think we should have only one language , " Roth says . " They should speak English . I 'm tired of ' press two and speak English ' anymore . It 's almost that bad . " But Roth is quick to point out that her criticism does not apply to congressional candidate Abel Maldonado . " He 's fine , " Roth notes , adding " he 's an American -- he 's not a Latino . You 're either an illegal or an American . That 's all there is . " <p> Latinos might cringe at that characterization . But not all Hispanic voters here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . <p> Standing behind a table at the market , Pablo Sanchez is describing the award-winning olive oils made on his Paso Robles farm . This fifth generation Mexican American says he 's leaning toward Abel Maldonado -- mostly because he seems bipartisan . <p> " I think the government should stop their infighting , " Sanchez says . " Get rid of the Republican and Democratic and all that . And become Americans for America . " <p> Asked if it matters to him that Maldonado is Latino , Sanchez insists it does not . " He is of our race , " Sanchez says . " If he wins , great . I hope he does a good job for us . You know ? As long as they look out for America . <p> But standing right next to Sanchez , his cousin Lucas Hay has a very different take on politics -- and Maldonado . " More Latinos that are n't informed about what 's going on in the debates are more likely to vote for Maldonado because of his last name , " Hay says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issues going on . " <p> Hay says he favors Democrats because they seem to care more about helping those with less . He 'll be voting for the incumbent in this congressional race , Democrat Lois Capps . <p> Polls show the race is tight . If Maldonado ekes out a win , his candidacy could provide a roadmap back to relevance for the Republican Party in California . <h> MORE POSTS ABOUT <p> The election blog is coming to an end soon &lt;sniff ! &gt; so this is the last update I 'll be posting on those stubbornly close races .

##257952 <h> Sen. Howard Cannon 's efforts opened the door for major properties <p> LAS VEGAS -- After the sawdust joints opened across Las Vegas , betting at sports books would soon to be taken to a completely different level . The major change began on the political landscape and the boost that came from a U.S. Sen. Howard Cannon ( D-NV ) , who was strong and forthright and saw an opportunity for sports and race wagering to help evolve the state into even more of a resort destination . <p> The hotels were not going to budge from the handshake deal they had with the independent joints they were dealing with . The 10 percent excise tax was too burdensome for the heavyweight casinos . So Cannon led a major charge within the state and got it reduced to a 2 percent luxury tax in the 1970s , and subsequently a few years later to the .025 percent that we currently pay . <p> Once the reduction was declared , the big question was which major hotel would be first to dive in with the new favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which opened a magnificent race and sports book in what I remember to be in late 1974 or early ' 75 . Jackie Gaughan brought in two bookmaking giants to run it , Johnny Quinn and Bob Martin . <p> William Hill now runs the Union Plaza race and sports book , and it actually sits in the same location it did when it opened . I actually had the same office that was once occupied by Quinn . <p> It was an exciting time , and Bob and his crew made it even more so . They started the first significant televised sports betting show . It was held every Monday at noon , and it was something to see and be seen at . <p> The show was held in the showroom and hosted by Tom Kelly with an All-Star panel of bookmakers and bettors . Martin would give his opening line for the week of upcoming games and then Lem Banker and Bobby " Hunchy " Berendt would comment on the games and the sides they were leaning to . <p> The place was jammed with every mover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance wrote down every number and as much of the conversation they could . <p> I was absolutely privileged to become close friends with " Hunchy , " who called me " Jimmy Boy . " Bobby beat the college baskets like no one at that time , and he also loved the ponies . He was also my fantasy football partner for five years until his health started to go south , but I cherished every moment I had with him while he was with us . <p> When the show was over , there was a mad dash to the phones to service every big time outfit from coast to coast . It really was a magical time to be in Las Vegas . <p> Then came the lefthander -- Lefty Rosenthal , the character portrayed by Robert DeNiro in the movie Casino . He opened the Stardust , took the negative stigma out of the book and created the first state-of-the-art race and sports book , dressing it up like no other at the time . The massive board with all teams and spreads on it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction . It was a precursor to the " racket " that was about to become bigger than ever . <p> Ronsenthal deserves a lot of credit . To this day , I really do n't know what hotel was next in line to have a race and sports book inside . It was either Sonny Reizner at the famous Castaways , located where the Mirage now sits , or Michael Gaughan 's Royal Inn , which was right in the middle of Convention Center Drive between the Stardust and Hilton . <p> By the way , Gaughan hired some young kid to run it for him . He said , " Jimmy , do you know how to run a sports book ? " And I simply replied , " No . " <p> His answer to this day still astounds me . He said , " Good . Neither do I , so we will start together . " <p> By the way , my first hire at the Royal Inn was Johnny " Spot " Druzisky , who still holds court and runs the book for Caesars Entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wild Bill 's . <p> When we mention the name Sonny Reizner , we also have to credit him for being at the forefront of introducing propositions , and he should always be remembered for those contributions . He brought an entirely new element to the sports books , where bettors could make wagers on items beyond the game itself using player statistics . <p> So now we have a few hotels in the sports book industry , and everyone knew what should and could be on the horizon . Having a race and sports book in the casino proved to turn a profit , and that got all the heavyweights around town wanting to be a part of it . <p> Had Howard Cannon not had the vision he did , it 's hard to imagine the rapid growth of sports betting in Nevada becoming what it has , or at least not as fast . <p> Next week , we 'll talk about the Barbary Coast -- a place I worked -- that kind of forced competitors around the neighboring area to open their own book rather than lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street to play with us . <h> More Expert Analysis <p> We 've done some homework to help you with your Saturday college football wager-palooza and identified some games where the lines are off . Do the oddmakers have the wrong team favored in the big USC-UCLA game ? <p> For years , the vast majority of Patriots fans subscribed to the phrase : ' In Bill we trust .

##260751 <h> The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine <p> Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page <p> sergey , page@cs.stanford.edu <p> Computer Science Department , Stanford University , Stanford , CA 94305 <h> Abstract <p> In this paper , we present Google , a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext . Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems . The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http : //google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task . Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms . They answer tens of millions of queries every day . Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web , very little academic research has been done on them . Furthermore , due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation , creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date . Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude , there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results . This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext . Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want . <h> 1 . Introduction <p> ( Note : There are two versions of this paper -- a longer full version and a shorter printed version . The full version is available on the web and the conference CD-ROM . ) The web creates new challenges for information retrieval . The amount of information on the web is growing rapidly , as well as the number of new users inexperienced in the art of web research . People are likely to surf the web using its link graph , often starting with high quality human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Human maintained lists cover popular topics effectively but are subjective , expensive to build and maintain , slow to improve , and can not cover all esoteric topics . Automated search engines that rely on keyword matching usually return too many low quality matches . To make matters worse , some advertisers attempt to gain people 's attention by taking measures meant to mislead automated search engines . We have built a large-scale search engine which addresses many of the problems of existing systems . It makes especially heavy use of the additional structure present in hypertext to provide much higher quality search results . We chose our system name , Google , because it is a common spelling of googol , or 10 100 and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines . <h> 1.1 Web Search Engines -- Scaling Up : 1994 - 2000 <p> Search engine technology has had to scale dramatically to keep up with the growth of the web . In 1994 , one of the first web search engines , the World Wide Web Worm ( WWWW ) McBryan 94 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents . As of November , 1997 , the top search engines claim to index from 2 million ( WebCrawler ) to 100 million web documents ( from Search Engine Watch ) . It is foreseeable that by the year 2000 , a comprehensive index of the Web will contain over a billion documents . At the same time , the number of queries search engines handle has grown incredibly too . In March and April 1994 , the World Wide Web Worm received an average of about 1500 queries per day . In November 1997 , Altavista claimed it handled roughly 20 million queries per day . With the increasing number of users on the web , and automated systems which query search engines , it is likely that top search engines will handle hundreds of millions of queries per day by the year 2000 . The goal of our system is to address many of the problems , both in quality and scalability , introduced by scaling search engine technology to such extraordinary numbers . <h> 1.2 . Google : Scaling with the Web <p> Creating a search engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fast crawling technology is needed to gather the web documents and keep them up to date . Storage space must be used efficiently to store indices and , optionally , the documents themselves . The indexing system must process hundreds of gigabytes of data efficiently . Queries must be handled quickly , at a rate of hundreds to thousands per second . <p> These tasks are becoming increasingly difficult as the Web grows . However , hardware performance and cost have improved dramatically to partially offset the difficulty . There are , however , several notable exceptions to this progress such as disk seek time and operating system robustness . In designing Google , we have considered both the rate of growth of the Web and technological changes . Google is designed to scale well to extremely large data sets . It makes efficient use of storage space to store the index . Its data structures are optimized for fast and efficient access ( see section 4.2 ) . Further , we expect that the cost to index and store text or HTML will eventually decline relative to the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will result in favorable scaling properties for centralized systems like Google. <h> 1.3 Design Goals <h> 1.3.1 Improved Search Quality <p> Our main goal is to improve the quality of web search engines . In 1994 , some people believed that a complete search index would make it possible to find anything easily . According to Best of the Web 1994 -- Navigators , " The best navigation service should make it easy to find almost anything on the Web ( once all the data is entered ) . " However , the Web of 1997 is quite different . Anyone who has used a search engine recently , can readily testify that the completeness of the index is not the only factor in the quality of search results . " Junk results " often wash out any results that a user is interested in . In fact , as of November 1997 , only one of the top four commercial search engines finds itself ( returns its own search page in response to its name in the top ten results ) . One of the main causes of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been increasing by many orders of magnitude , but the user 's ability to look at documents has not . People are still only willing to look at the first few tens of results . Because of this , as the collection size grows , we need tools that have very high precision ( number of relevant documents returned , say in the top tens of results ) . Indeed , we want our notion of " relevant " to only include the very best documents since there may be tens of thousands of slightly relevant documents . This very high precision is important even at the expense of recall ( the total number of relevant documents the system is able to return ) . There is quite a bit of recent optimism that the use of more hypertextual information can help improve search and other applications Marchiori 97 Spertus 97 Weiss 96 Kleinberg 98 . In particular , link structure Page 98 and link text provide a lot of information for making relevance judgments and quality filtering . Google makes use of both link structure and anchor text ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Search Engine Research <p> Aside from tremendous growth , the Web has also become increasingly commercial over time . In 1993 , 1.5% of web servers were on . com domains . This number grew to over 60% in 1997 . At the same time , search engines have migrated from the academic domain to the commercial . Up until now most search engine development has gone on at companies with little publication of technical details . This causes search engine technology to remain largely a black art and to be advertising oriented ( see Appendix A ) . With Google , we have a strong goal to push more development and understanding into the academic realm . <p> Another important design goal was to build systems that reasonable numbers of people can actually use . Usage was important to us because we think some of the most interesting research will involve leveraging the vast amount of usage data that is available from modern web systems . For example , there are many tens of millions of searches performed every day . However , it is very difficult to get this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Our final design goal was to build an architecture that can support novel research activities on large-scale web data . To support novel research uses , Google stores all of the actual documents it crawls in compressed form . One of our main goals in designing Google was to set up an environment where other researchers can come in quickly , process large chunks of the web , and produce interesting results that would have been very difficult to produce otherwise . In the short time the system has been up , there have already been several papers using databases generated by Google , and many others are underway . Another goal we have is to set up a Spacelab-like environment where researchers or even students can propose and do interesting experiments on our large-scale web data . <h> 2 . System Features <p> The Google search engine has two important features that help it produce high precision results . First , it makes use of the link structure of the Web to calculate a quality ranking for each web page . This ranking is called PageRank and is described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link to improve search results . <h> 2.1 PageRank : Bringing Order to the Web <p> The citation ( link ) graph of the web is an important resource that has largely gone unused in existing web search engines . We have created maps containing as many as 518 million of these hyperlinks , a significant sample of the total . These maps allow rapid calculation of a web page 's " PageRank " , an objective measure of its citation importance that corresponds well with people 's subjective idea of importance . Because of this correspondence , PageRank is an excellent way to prioritize the results of web keyword searches . For most popular subjects , a simple text matching search that is restricted to web page titles performs admirably when PageRank prioritizes the results ( demo available at google.stanford.edu ) . For the type of full text searches in the main Google system , PageRank also helps a great deal . <h> 2.1.1 Description of PageRank Calculation <p> Academic citation literature has been applied to the web , largely by counting citations or backlinks to a given page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . PageRank extends this idea by not counting links from all pages equally , and by normalizing by the number of links on a page . PageRank is defined as follows : <p> We assume page A has pages T1 ... Tn which point to it ( i.e. , are citations ) . The parameter d is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1 . We usually set d to 0.85 . There are more details about d in the next section . Also C(A) is defined as the number of links going out of page A. The PageRank of a page A is given as follows : <p> PR(A) = ( 1-d ) + d ( PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn) ) <p> Note that the PageRanks form a probability distribution over web pages , so the sum of all web pages ' PageRanks will be one . <p> PageRank or PR(A) can be calculated using a simple iterative algorithm , and corresponds to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the web . Also , a PageRank for 26 million web pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size workstation . There are many other details which are beyond the scope of this paper . <h> 2.1.2 Intuitive Justification <p> PageRank can be thought of as a model of user behavior . We assume there is a " random surfer " who is given a web page at random and keeps clicking on links , never hitting " back " but eventually gets bored and starts on another random page . The probability that the random surfer visits a page is its PageRank . And , the d damping factor is the probability at each page the " random surfer " will get bored and request another random page . One important variation is to only add the damping factor d to a single page , or a group of pages . This allows for personalization and can make it nearly impossible to deliberately mislead the system in order to get a higher ranking . We have several other extensions to PageRank , again see Page 98 . <p> Another intuitive justification is that a page can have a high PageRank if there are many pages that point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it and have a high PageRank . Intuitively , pages that are well cited from many places around the web are worth looking at . Also , pages that have perhaps only one citation from something like the Yahoo ! homepage are also generally worth looking at . If a page was not high quality , or was a broken link , it is quite likely that Yahoo 's homepage would not link to it . PageRank handles both these cases and everything in between by recursively propagating weights through the link structure of the web . <h> 2.2 Anchor Text <p> The text of links is treated in a special way in our search engine . Most search engines associate the text of a link with the page that the link is on . In addition , we associate it with the page the link points to . This has several advantages . First , anchors often provide more accurate descriptions of web pages than the pages themselves . Second , anchors may exist for documents which can not be indexed by a text-based search engine , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to return web pages which have not actually been crawled . Note that pages that have not been crawled can cause problems , since they are never checked for validity before being returned to the user . In this case , the search engine can even return a page that never actually existed , but had hyperlinks pointing to it . However , it is possible to sort the results , so that this particular problem rarely happens . <p> This idea of propagating anchor text to the page it refers to was implemented in the World Wide Web Worm McBryan 94 especially because it helps search non-text information , and expands the search coverage with fewer downloaded documents . We use anchor propagation mostly because anchor text can help provide better quality results . Using anchor text efficiently is technically difficult because of the large amounts of data which must be processed . In our current crawl of 24 million pages , we had over 259 million anchors which we indexed . <h> 2.3 Other Features <p> Aside from PageRank and the use of anchor text , Google has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all hits and so it makes extensive use of proximity in search . Second , Google keeps track of some visual presentation details such as font size of words . Words in a larger or bolder font are weighted higher than other words . Third , full raw HTML of pages is available in a repository . <h> 3 Related Work <p> Search research on the web has a short and concise history . The World Wide Web Worm ( WWWW ) McBryan 94 was one of the first web search engines . It was subsequently followed by several other academic search engines , many of which are now public companies . Compared to the growth of the Web and the importance of search engines there are precious few documents about recent search engines Pinkerton 94 . According to Michael Mauldin ( chief scientist , Lycos Inc ) Mauldin , " the various services ( including Lycos ) closely guard the details of these databases " . However , there has been a fair amount of work on specific features of search engines . Especially well represented is work which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search engines , or produce small scale " individualized " search engines . Finally , there has been a lot of research on information retrieval systems , especially on well controlled collections . In the next two sections , we discuss some areas where this research needs to be extended to work better on the web . <h> 3.1 Information Retrieval <p> Work in information retrieval systems goes back many years and is well developed Witten 94 . However , most of the research on information retrieval systems is on small well controlled homogeneous collections such as collections of scientific papers or news stories on a related topic . Indeed , the primary benchmark for information retrieval , the Text Retrieval Conference TREC 96 , uses a fairly small , well controlled collection for their benchmarks . The " Very Large Corpus " benchmark is only 20GB compared to the 147GB from our crawl of 24 million web pages . Things that work well on TREC often do not produce good results on the web . For example , the standard vector space model tries to return the document that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document are vectors defined by their word occurrence . On the web , this strategy often returns very short documents that are the query plus a few words . For example , we have seen a major search engine return a page containing only " Bill Clinton Sucks " and picture from a " Bill Clinton " query . Some argue that on the web , users should specify more accurately what they want and add more words to their query . We disagree vehemently with this position . If a user issues a query like " Bill Clinton " they should get reasonable results since there is a enormous amount of high quality information available on this topic . Given examples like these , we believe that the standard information retrieval work needs to be extended to deal effectively with the web . <h> 3.2 Differences Between the Web and Well Controlled Collections <p> The web is a vast collection of completely uncontrolled heterogeneous documents . Documents on the web have extreme variation internal to the documents , and also in the external meta information that might be available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both human and programming ) , vocabulary ( email addresses , links , zip codes , phone numbers , product numbers ) , type or format ( text , HTML , PDF , images , sounds ) , and may even be machine generated ( log files or output from a database ) . On the other hand , we define external meta information as information that can be inferred about a document , but is not contained within it . Examples of external meta information include things like reputation of the source , update frequency , quality , popularity or usage , and citations . Not only are the possible sources of external meta information varied , but the things that are being measured vary many orders of magnitude as well . For example , compare the usage information from a major homepage , like Yahoo 's which currently receives millions of page views every day with an obscure historical article which might receive one view every ten years . Clearly , these two items must be treated very differently by a search engine . <p> Another big difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is virtually no control over what people can put on the web . Couple this flexibility to publish anything with the enormous influence of search engines to route traffic and companies which deliberately manipulating search engines for profit become a serious problem . This problem that has not been addressed in traditional closed information retrieval systems . Also , it is interesting to note that metadata efforts have largely failed with web search engines , because any text on the page which is not directly represented to the user is abused to manipulate search engines . There are even numerous companies which specialize in manipulating search engines for profit . <h> 4 System Anatomy <p> First , we will provide a high level discussion of the architecture . Then , there is some in-depth descriptions of important data structures . Finally , the major applications : crawling , indexing , and searching will be examined in depth . <p> Figure 1 . High Level Google Architecture <h> 4.1 Google Architecture Overview <p> In this section , we will give a high level overview of how the whole system works as pictured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and data structures not mentioned in this section . Most of Google is implemented in C or C++ for efficiency and can run in either Solaris or Linux . <p> In Google , the web crawling ( downloading of web pages ) is done by several distributed crawlers . There is a URLserver that sends lists of URLs to be fetched to the crawlers . The web pages that are fetched are then sent to the storeserver . The storeserver then compresses and stores the web pages into a repository . Every web page has an associated ID number called a docID which is assigned whenever a new URL is parsed out of a web page . The indexing function is performed by the indexer and the sorter . The indexer performs a number of functions . It reads the repository , uncompresses the documents , and parses them . Each document is converted into a set of word occurrences called hits . The hits record the word , position in document , an approximation of font size , and capitalization . The indexer distributes these hits into a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The indexer performs another important function . It parses out all the links in every web page and stores important information about them in an anchors file . This file contains enough information to determine where each link points from and to , and the text of the link . <p> The URLresolver reads the anchors file and converts relative URLs into absolute URLs and in turn into docIDs . It puts the anchor text into the forward index , associated with the docID that the anchor points to . It also generates a database of links which are pairs of docIDs . The links database is used to compute PageRanks for all the documents . <p> The sorter takes the barrels , which are sorted by docID ( this is a simplification , see Section 4.2.5 ) , and resorts them by wordID to generate the inverted index . This is done in place so that little temporary space is needed for this operation . The sorter also produces a list of wordIDs and offsets into the inverted index . A program called DumpLexicon takes this list together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lexicon to be used by the searcher . The searcher is run by a web server and uses the lexicon built by DumpLexicon together with the inverted index and the PageRanks to answer queries . <h> 4.2 Major Data Structures <p> Google 's data structures are optimized so that a large document collection can be crawled , indexed , and searched with little cost . Although , CPUs and bulk input output rates have improved dramatically over the years , a disk seek still requires about 10 ms to complete . Google is designed to avoid disk seeks whenever possible , and this has had a considerable influence on the design of the data structures . <h> 4.2.1 BigFiles <p> BigFiles are virtual files spanning multiple file systems and are addressable by 64 bit integers . The allocation among multiple file systems is handled automatically . The BigFiles package also handles allocation and deallocation of file descriptors , since the operating systems do not provide enough for our needs . BigFiles also support rudimentary compression options . <h> 4.2.2 Repository <p> Figure 2 . Repository Data Structure <p> The repository contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is compressed using zlib ( see RFC1950 ) . The choice of compression technique is a tradeoff between speed and compression ratio . We chose zlib 's speed over a significant improvement in compression offered by bzip . The compression rate of bzip was approximately 4 to 1 on the repository as compared to zlib 's 3 to 1 compression . In the repository , the documents are stored one after the other and are prefixed by docID , length , and URL as can be seen in Figure 2 . The repository requires no other data structures to be used in order to access it . This helps with data consistency and makes development much easier ; we can rebuild all the other data structures from only the repository and a file which lists crawler errors . <h> 4.2.3 Document Index <p> The document index keeps information about each document . It is a fixed width ISAM ( Index sequential access mode ) index , ordered by docID . The information stored in each entry includes the current document status , a pointer into the repository , a document checksum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawled , it also contains a pointer into a variable width file called docinfo which contains its URL and title . Otherwise the pointer points into the URLlist which contains just the URL . This design decision was driven by the desire to have a reasonably compact data structure , and the ability to fetch a record in one disk seek during a search <p> Additionally , there is a file which is used to convert URLs into docIDs . It is a list of URL checksums with their corresponding docIDs and is sorted by checksum . In order to find the docID of a particular URL , the URL 's checksum is computed and a binary search is performed on the checksums file to find its docID . URLs may be converted into docIDs in batch by doing a merge with this file . This is the technique the URLresolver uses to turn URLs into docIDs . This batch mode of update is crucial because otherwise we must perform one seek for every link which assuming one disk would take more than a month for our 322 million link dataset. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One important change from earlier systems is that the lexicon can fit in memory for a reasonable price . In the current implementation we can keep the lexicon in memory on a machine with 256 MB of main memory . The current lexicon contains 14 million words ( though some rare words were not added to the lexicon ) . It is implemented in two parts -- a list of the words ( concatenated together but separated by nulls ) and a hash table of pointers . For various functions , the list of words has some auxiliary information which is beyond the scope of this paper to explain fully . <h> 4.2.5 Hit Lists <p> A hit list corresponds to a list of occurrences of a particular word in a particular document including position , font , and capitalization information . Hit lists account for most of the space used in both the forward and the inverted indices . Because of this , it is important to represent them as efficiently as possible . We considered several alternatives for encoding position , font , and capitalization -- simple encoding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a hand optimized allocation of bits ) , and Huffman coding . In the end we chose a hand optimized compact encoding since it required far less space than the simple encoding and far less bit manipulation than Huffman coding . The details of the hits are shown in Figure 3 . <p> Our compact encoding uses two bytes for every hit . There are two types of hits : fancy hits and plain hits . Fancy hits include hits occurring in a URL , title , anchor text , or meta tag . Plain hits include everything else . A plain hit consists of a capitalization bit , font size , and 12 bits of word position in a document ( all positions higher than 4095 are labeled 4096 ) . Font size is represented relative to the rest of the document using three bits ( only 7 values are actually used because 111 is the flag that signals a fancy hit ) . A fancy hit consists of a capitalization bit , the font size set to 7 to indicate it is a fancy hit , 4 bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of position . For anchor hits , the 8 bits of position are split into 4 bits for position in anchor and 4 bits for a hash of the docID the anchor occurs in . This gives us some limited phrase searching as long as there are not that many anchors for a particular word . We expect to update the way that anchor hits are stored to allow for greater resolution in the position and docIDhash fields . We use font size relative to the rest of the document because when searching , you do not want to rank otherwise identical documents differently just because one of the documents is in a larger font . <p> Figure 3 . Forward and Reverse Indexes and the Lexicon <p> The length of a hit list is stored before the hits themselves . To save space , the length of the hit list is combined with the wordID in the forward index and the docID in the inverted index . This limits it to 8 and 5 bits respectively ( there are some tricks which allow 8 bits to be borrowed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fit in that many bits , an escape code is used in those bits , and the next two bytes contain the actual length . <h> 4.2.6 Forward Index <p> The forward index is actually already partially sorted . It is stored in a number of barrels ( we used 64 ) . Each barrel holds a range of wordID 's . If a document contains words that fall into a particular barrel , the docID is recorded into the barrel , followed by a list of wordID 's with hitlists which correspond to those words . This scheme requires slightly more storage because of duplicated docIDs but the difference is very small for a reasonable number of buckets and saves considerable time and coding complexity in the final indexing phase done by the sorter . Furthermore , instead of storing actual wordID 's , we store each wordID as a relative difference from the minimum wordID that falls into the barrel the wordID is in . This way , we can use just 24 bits for the wordID 's in the unsorted barrels , leaving 8 bits for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inverted index consists of the same barrels as the forward index , except that they have been processed by the sorter . For every valid wordID , the lexicon contains a pointer into the barrel that wordID falls into . It points to a doclist of docID 's together with their corresponding hit lists . This doclist represents all the occurrences of that word in all documents . <p> An important issue is in what order the docID 's should appear in the doclist . One simple solution is to store them sorted by docID . This allows for quick merging of different doclists for multiple word queries . Another option is to store them sorted by a ranking of the occurrence of the word in each document . This makes answering one word queries trivial and makes it likely that the answers to multiple word queries are near the start . However , merging is much more difficult . Also , this makes development much more difficult in that a change to the ranking function requires a rebuild of the index . We chose a compromise between these options , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit lists which include title or anchor hits and another set for all hit lists . This way , we check the first set of barrels first and if there are not enough matches within those barrels we check the larger ones . <h> 4.3 Crawling the Web <p> Running a web crawler is a challenging task . There are tricky performance and reliability issues and even more importantly , there are social issues . Crawling is the most fragile application since it involves interacting with hundreds of thousands of web servers and various name servers which are all beyond the control of the system . <p> In order to scale to hundreds of millions of web pages , Google has a fast distributed crawling system . A single URLserver serves lists of URLs to a number of crawlers ( we typically ran about 3 ) . Both the URLserver and the crawlers are implemented in Python . Each crawler keeps roughly 300 connections open at once . This is necessary to retrieve web pages at a fast enough pace . At peak speeds , the system can crawl over 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to roughly 600K per second of data . A major performance stress is DNS lookup . Each crawler maintains a its own DNS cache so it does not need to do a DNS lookup before crawling each document . Each of the hundreds of connections can be in a number of different states : looking up DNS , connecting to host , sending request , and receiving response . These factors make the crawler a complex component of the system . It uses asynchronous IO to manage events , and a number of queues to move page fetches from state to state . <p> It turns out that running a crawler which connects to more than half a million servers , and generates tens of millions of log entries generates a fair amount of email and phone calls . Because of the vast number of people coming on line , there are always those who do not know what a crawler is , because this is the first one they have seen . Almost daily , we receive an email something like , " Wow , you looked at a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it ? " There are also some people who do not know about the robots exclusion protocol , and think their page should be protected from indexing by a statement like , " This page is copyrighted and should not be indexed " , which needless to say is difficult for web crawlers to understand . Also , because of the huge amount of data involved , unexpected things will happen . For example , our system tried to crawl an online game . This resulted in lots of garbage messages in the middle of their game ! It turns out this was an easy problem to fix . But this problem had not come up until we had downloaded tens of millions of pages . Because of the immense variation in web pages and servers , it is virtually impossible to test a crawler without running it on large part of the Internet . Invariably , there are hundreds of obscure problems which may only occur on one page out of the whole web and cause the crawler to crash , or worse , cause unpredictable or incorrect behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be designed to be very robust and carefully tested . Since large complex systems such as crawlers will invariably cause problems , there needs to be significant resources devoted to reading the email and solving these problems as they come up . <h> 4.4 Indexing the Web <p> Parsing -- Any parser which is designed to run on the entire Web must handle a huge array of possible errors . These range from typos in HTML tags to kilobytes of zeros in the middle of a tag , non-ASCII characters , HTML tags nested hundreds deep , and a great variety of other errors that challenge anyone 's imagination to come up with equally creative ones . For maximum speed , instead of using YACC to generate a CFG parser , we use flex to generate a lexical analyzer which we outfit with its own stack . Developing this parser which runs at a reasonable speed and is very robust involved a fair amount of work . <p> Indexing Documents into Barrels -- After each document is parsed , it is encoded into a number of barrels . Every word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table -- the lexicon . New additions to the lexicon hash table are logged to a file . Once the words are converted into wordID 's , their occurrences in the current document are translated into hit lists and are written into the forward barrels . The main difficulty with parallelization of the indexing phase is that the lexicon needs to be shared . Instead of sharing the lexicon , we took the approach of writing a log of all the extra words that were not in a base lexicon , which we fixed at 14 million words . That way multiple indexers can run in parallel and then the small log file of extra words can be processed by one final indexer . <p> Sorting -- In order to generate the inverted index , the sorter takes each of the forward barrels and sorts it by wordID to produce an inverted barrel for title and anchor hits and a full text inverted barrel . This process happens one barrel at a time , thus requiring little temporary storage . Also , we parallelize the sorting phase to use as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can process different buckets at the same time . Since the barrels do n't fit into main memory , the sorter further subdivides them into baskets which do fit into memory based on wordID and docID . Then the sorter , loads each basket into memory , sorts it and writes its contents into the short inverted barrel and the full inverted barrel . <h> 4.5 Searching <p> The goal of searching is to provide quality search results efficiently . Many of the large commercial search engines seemed to have made great progress in terms of efficiency . Therefore , we have focused more on quality of search in our research , although we believe our solutions are scalable to commercial volumes with a bit more effort . The google query evaluation process is show in Figure 4 . <p> Parse the query . <p> Convert words into wordIDs . <p> Seek to the start of the doclist in the short barrel for every word . <p> Scan through the doclists until there is a document that matches all the search terms . <p> Compute the rank of that document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short barrels and at the end of any doclist , seek to the start of the doclist in the full barrel for every word and go to step 4 . <p> If we are not at the end of any doclist go to step 4 . <p> Sort the documents that have matched by rank and return the top k . <p> Figure 4 . Google Query Evaluation <p> To put a limit on response time , once a certain number ( currently 40,000 ) of matching documents are found , the searcher automatically goes to step 8 in Figure 4 . This means that it is possible that sub-optimal results would be returned . We are currently investigating other ways to solve this problem . In the past , we sorted the hits according to PageRank , which seemed to improve the situation . <h> 4.5.1 The Ranking System <p> Google maintains much more information about web documents than typical search engines . Every hitlist includes position , font , and capitalization information . Additionally , we factor in hits from anchor text and the PageRank of the document . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We designed our ranking function so that no particular factor can have too much influence . First , consider the simplest case -- a single word query . In order to rank a document with a single word query , Google looks at that document 's hit list for that word . Google considers each hit to be one of several different types ( title , anchor , URL , plain text large font , plain text small font , ... ) , each of which has its own type-weight . The type-weights make up a vector indexed by type . Google counts the number of hits of each type in the hit list . Then every count is converted into a count-weight . Count-weights increase linearly with counts at first but quickly taper off so that more than a certain count will not help . We take the dot product of the vector of count-weights with the vector of type-weights to compute an IR score for the document . Finally , the IR score is combined with PageRank to give a final rank to the document . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now multiple hit lists must be scanned through at once so that hits occurring close together in a document are weighted higher than hits occurring far apart . The hits from the multiple hit lists are matched up so that nearby hits are matched together . For every matched set of hits , a proximity is computed . The proximity is based on how far apart the hits are in the document ( or anchor ) but is classified into 10 different value " bins " ranging from a phrase match to " not even close " . Counts are computed not only for every type of hit but for every type and proximity . Every type and proximity pair has a type-prox-weight . The counts are converted into count-weights and we take the dot product of the count-weights and the type-prox-weights to compute an IR score . All of these numbers and matrices can all be displayed with the search results using a special debug mode . These displays have been very helpful in developing the ranking system . <h> 4.5.2 Feedback <p> The ranking function has many parameters like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values for these parameters is something of a black art . In order to do this , we have a user feedback mechanism in the search engine . A trusted user may optionally evaluate all of the results that are returned . This feedback is saved . Then when we modify the ranking function , we can see the impact of this change on all previous searches which were ranked . Although far from perfect , this gives us some idea of how a change in the ranking function affects the search results . <p> The most important measure of a search engine is the quality of its search results . While a complete user evaluation is beyond the scope of this paper , our own experience with Google has shown it to produce better results than the major commercial search engines for most searches . As an example which illustrates the use of PageRank , anchor text , and proximity , Figure 4 shows Google 's results for a search on " bill clinton " . These results demonstrates some of Google 's features . The results are clustered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A number of results are from the whitehouse.gov domain which is what one may reasonably expect from such a search . Currently , most major commercial search engines do not return any results from whitehouse.gov , much less the right ones . Notice that there is no title for the first result . This is because it was not crawled . Instead , Google relied on anchor text to determine this was a good answer to the query . Similarly , the fifth result is an email address which , of course , is not crawlable . It is also a result of anchor text . <p> All of the results are reasonably high quality pages and , at last check , none were broken links . This is largely because they all have high PageRank . The PageRanks are the percentages in red along with bar graphs . Finally , there are no results about a Bill other than Clinton or about a Clinton other than Bill . This is because we place heavy importance on the proximity of word occurrences . Of course a true test of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study or results analysis which we do not have room for here . Instead , we invite the reader to try Google for themselves at http : //google.stanford.edu . <h> 5.1 Storage Requirements <p> Aside from search quality , Google is designed to scale cost effectively to the size of the Web as it grows . One aspect of this is to use storage efficiently . Table 1 has a breakdown of some statistics and storage requirements of Google . Due to compression the total size of the repository is about 53 GB , just over one third of the total data it stores . At current disk prices this makes the repository a relatively cheap source of useful data . More importantly , the total of all the data used by the search engine requires a comparable amount of storage , about 55 GB . Furthermore , most queries can be answered using just the short inverted index . With better encoding and compression of the Document Index , a high quality web search engine may fit onto a 7GB drive of a new PC . <p> Storage Statistics <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repository <p> 53.5 GB <p> Short Inverted Index <p> 4.1 GB <p> Full Inverted Index <p> 37.2 GB <p> Lexicon <p> 293 MB <p> Temporary Anchor Data ( not in total ) <p> 6.6 GB <p> Document Index Incl . Variable Width Data <p> 9.7 GB <p> Links Database <p> 3.9 GB <p> Total Without Repository <p> 55.2 GB <p> Total With Repository <p> 108.7 GB <p> Web Page Statistics <p> Number of Web Pages Fetched <p> 24 million <p> Number of Urls Seen <p> 76.5 million <p> Number of Email Addresses <p> 1.7 million <p> Number of 404 's <p> 1.6 million <p> Table 1 . Statistics <h> 5.2 System Performance <p> It is important for a search engine to crawl and index efficiently . This way information can be kept up to date and major changes to the system can be tested relatively quickly . For Google , the major operations are Crawling , Indexing , and Sorting . It is difficult to measure how long crawling took overall because disks filled up , name servers crashed , or any number of other problems which stopped the system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 million pages ( including errors ) . However , once the system was running smoothly , it ran much faster , downloading the last 11 million pages in just 63 hours , averaging just over 4 million pages per day or 48.5 pages per second . We ran the indexer and the crawler simultaneously . The indexer ran just faster than the crawlers . This is largely because we spent just enough time optimizing the indexer so that it would not be a bottleneck . These optimizations included bulk updates to the document index and placement of critical data structures on the local disk . The indexer runs at roughly 54 pages per second . The sorters can be run completely in parallel ; using four machines , the whole process of sorting takes about 24 hours . <h> 5.3 Search Performance <p> Improving the performance of search was not the major focus of our research up to this point . The current version of Google answers most queries in between 1 and 10 seconds . This time is mostly dominated by disk IO over NFS ( since disks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google does not have any optimizations such as query caching , subindices on common terms , and other common optimizations . We intend to speed up Google considerably through distribution and hardware , software , and algorithmic improvements . Our target is to be able to handle several hundred queries per second . Table 2 has some sample query times from the current version of Google . They are repeated to show the speedups resulting from cached IO . <p> Initial Query <p> Same Query Repeated ( IO mostly cached ) <p> Query <p> CPU Time(s) <p> Total Time(s) <p> CPU Time(s) <p> Total Time(s) <p> al gore <p> 0.09 <p> 2.13 <p> 0.06 <p> 0.06 <p> vice president <p> 1.77 <p> 3.84 <p> 1.66 <p> 1.80 <p> hard disks <p> 0.25 <p> 4.86 <p> 0.20 <p> 0.24 <p> search engines <p> 1.31 <p> 9.63 <p> 1.16 <p> 1.16 <p> Table 2 . Search Times <h> 6 Conclusions <p> Google is designed to be a scalable search engine . The primary goal is to provide high quality search results over a rapidly growing World Wide Web . Google employs a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor text , and proximity information . Furthermore , Google is a complete architecture for gathering web pages , indexing them , and performing search queries over them . <h> 6.1 Future Work <p> A large-scale web search engine is a complex system and much remains to be done . Our immediate goals are to improve search efficiency and to scale to approximately 100 million web pages . Some simple improvements to efficiency include query caching , smart disk allocation , and subindices . Another area which requires much research is updates . We must have smart algorithms to decide what old web pages should be recrawled and what new ones should be crawled . Work toward this goal has been done in Cho 98 . One promising area of research is using proxy caches to build search databases , since they are demand driven . We are planning to add simple features supported by commercial search engines like boolean operators , negation , and stemming . However , other features are just starting to be explored such as relevance feedback and clustering ( Google currently supports a simple hostname based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( like the user 's location ) , and result summarization . We are also working to extend the use of link structure and link text . Simple experiments indicate PageRank can be personalized by increasing the weight of a user 's home page or bookmarks . As for link text , we are experimenting with using text surrounding links in addition to the link text itself . A Web search engine is a very rich environment for research ideas . We have far too many to list here so we do not expect this Future Work section to become much shorter in the near future . <h> 6.2 High Quality Search <p> The biggest problem facing users of web search engines today is the quality of the results they get back . While the results are often amusing and expand users ' horizons , they are often frustrating and consume precious time . For example , the top result for a search for " Bill Clinton " on one of the most popular commercial search engines was the Bill Clinton Joke of the Day : April 14 , 1997 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Web continues to grow rapidly , information can be found easily . In order to accomplish this Google makes heavy use of hypertextual information consisting of link structure and link ( anchor ) text . Google also uses proximity and font information . While evaluation of a search engine is difficult , we have subjectively found that Google returns higher quality search results than current commercial search engines . The analysis of link structure via PageRank allows Google to evaluate the quality of web pages . The use of link text as a description of what the link points to helps the search engine return relevant ( and to some degree high quality ) results . Finally , the use of proximity information helps increase relevance a great deal for many queries . <h> 6.3 Scalable Architecture <p> Aside from the quality of search , Google is designed to scale . It must be efficient in both space and time , and constant factors are very important when dealing with the entire Web . In implementing Google , we have seen bottlenecks in CPU , memory access , memory capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and network IO . Google has evolved to overcome a number of these bottlenecks during various operations . Google 's major data structures make efficient use of available storage space . Furthermore , the crawling , indexing , and sorting operations are efficient enough to be able to build an index of a substantial portion of the web -- 24 million pages , in less than one week . We expect to be able to build an index of 100 million pages in less than a month . <h> 6.4 A Research Tool <p> In addition to being a high quality search engine , Google is a research tool . The data Google has collected has already resulted in many other papers submitted to conferences and many more on the way . Recent research such as Abiteboul 97 has shown a number of limitations to queries about the Web that may be answered without having the Web available locally . This means that Google ( or a similar system ) is not only a valuable research tool but a necessary one for a wide range of applications . We hope Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world and will spark the next generation of search engine technology . <h> 7 Acknowledgments <p> Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg have been critical to the development of Google .

Finally we would like to recognize the generous support of our equipment donors IBM , Intel , and Sun and our funders .

Funding for this cooperative agreement is also provided by DARPA and NASA , and by Interval Research , and the industrial partners of the Stanford Digital Libraries Project . <h> Vitae <p> Sergey Brin received his B.S. degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Maryland at College Park in 1993 . Currently , he is a Ph.D . candidate in computer science at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a recipient of a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship .

He is currently a Ph.D . candidate in Computer Science at Stanford University . Some of his research interests include the link structure of the web , human computer interaction , search engines , scalability of information access interfaces , and personal data mining . <h> 8 Appendix A : Advertising and Mixed Motives <p> Currently , the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising . The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users . For example , in our prototype search engine one of the top results for cellular phone is " The Effect of Cellular Phone Use Upon Driver Attention " , a study which explains in great detail the distractions and risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This search result came up first because of its high importance as judged by the PageRank algorithm , an approximation of citation importance on the web Page , 98 . It is clear that a search engine which was taking money for showing cellular phone ads would have difficulty justifying the page that our system returned to its paying advertisers . For this type of reason and historical experience with other media Bagdikian 83 , we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers . <p> Since it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines , search engine bias is particularly insidious . A good example was OpenText , which was reported to be selling companies the right to be listed at the top of the search results for particular queries Marchiori 97 . This type of bias is much more insidious than advertising , because it is not clear who " deserves " to be there , and who is willing to pay money to be listed . This business model resulted in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search engine . But less blatant bias are likely to be tolerated by the market . For example , a search engine could add a small factor to search results from " friendly " companies , and subtract a factor from results from competitors . This type of bias is very difficult to detect but could still have a significant effect on the market . Furthermore , advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results . For example , we noticed a major search engine would not return a large airline 's homepage when the airline 's name was given as a query . It so happened that the airline had placed an expensive ad , linked to the query that was its name . A better search engine would not have required this ad , and possibly resulted in the loss of the revenue from the airline to the search engine . In general , it could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is , the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model of the existing search engines . However , there will always be money from advertisers who want a customer to switch products , or have something that is genuinely new . But we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm . <h> 9 Appendix B : Scalability <h> 9. 1 Scalability of Google <p> We have designed Google to be scalable in the near term to a goal of 100 million web pages . We have just received disk and machines to handle roughly that amount . All of the time consuming parts of the system are parallelize and roughly linear time . These include things like the crawlers , indexers , and sorters . We also think that most of the data structures will deal gracefully with the expansion . However , at 100 million web pages we will be very close up against all sorts of operating system limits in the common operating systems ( currently we run on both Solaris and Linux ) . These include things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network sockets and bandwidth , and many others . We believe expanding to a lot more than 100 million pages would greatly increase the complexity of our system . <h> 9.2 Scalability of Centralized Indexing Architectures <p> As the capabilities of computers increase , it becomes possible to index a very large amount of text for a reasonable cost . Of course , other more bandwidth intensive media such as video is likely to become more pervasive . But , because the cost of production of text is low compared to media like video , text is likely to remain very pervasive . Also , it is likely that soon we will have speech recognition that does a reasonable job converting speech into text , expanding the amount of text available . All of this provides amazing possibilities for centralized indexing . Here is an illustrative example . We assume we want to index everything everyone in the US has written for a year . We assume that there are 250 million people in the US and they write an average of 10k per day . That works out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be done now for a reasonable cost . We also assume that the indexing methods used over the text are linear , or nearly linear in their complexity . Given all these assumptions we can compute how long it would take before we could index our 850 terabytes for a reasonable cost assuming certain growth factors . Moore 's Law was defined in 1965 as a doubling every 18 months in processor power . It has held remarkably true , not just for processors , but for other important system parameters such as disk as well . If we assume that Moore 's law holds for the future , we need only 10 more doublings , or 15 years to reach our goal of indexing everything everyone in the US has written for a year for a price that a small company could afford . Of course , hardware experts are somewhat concerned Moore 's Law may not continue to hold for the next 15 years , but there are certainly a lot of interesting centralized applications even if we only get part of the way to our hypothetical example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oss Gravano 94 or Harvest will often be the most efficient and elegant technical solution for indexing , but it seems difficult to convince the world to use these systems because of the high administration costs of setting up large numbers of installations . Of course , it is quite likely that reducing the administration cost drastically is possible . If that happens , and everyone starts running a distributed indexing system , searching would certainly improve drastically . <p> Because humans can only type or speak a finite amount , and as computers continue improving , text indexing will scale even better than it does now . Of course there could be an infinite amount of machine generated content , but just indexing huge amounts of human generated content seems tremendously useful . So we are optimistic that our centralized web search engine architecture will improve in its ability to cover the pertinent text information over

Ash dieback is caused by the fungus Chalara fraxinea and it will probably kill 99% of the ash trees in the UK . <p> Diseased trees will have to be identified and destroyed . This includes trees in nurseries and newly planted trees . Mature trees will be left standing , since they take longer to die and are valuable to wildlife . There is an import ban on ash trees that has been in place since October . <p> These measures wo n't eradicate this disease from the UK . Ash trees are the third most common in the UK , and there are as many as 90 million ash trees at risk .

The sites of infection are scattered all over the country , meaning that the spores were blown in the wind from continental Europe , where the fungus has ravaged ash trees from Poland to France for more than 10 years . <p> Ash trees grow quickly , reproduce quickly , and have a high capacity for self seeding , so reforestation might not be too difficult . The resistant strains of ash need to be identified so that they can be bred and repopulate ash trees . <p> One of the reasons why it 's taken so long to tackle the disease was that it was unclear what exactly was causing the dieback . Initially , mycologists attributed the dieback to Hymenoscyphus albidus , a species endemic to Europe . It was thought to have developed a more virulent strain . In 2011 , mycologists determined that it was down to another species altogether . <p> The latest biologists think that the fungus is native to Japan . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than that .

##289350 <h> 13 Originals <h> Founding the American Colonies <p> The history of the original 13 colonies is a tangled tale indeed . There are many ways to view the events and , in hind sight , it is easy to think you understand . But no one knew where they were headed at the time and it could have ended up very different . <p> Charter to Sir Walter Raleigh : 1584 Everybody remembers Jamestown , Capt . John Smith , Pocahontas and all the rest . But do you remember Roanoke ? In 1585 , after a small scouting expedition had returned from North America with two Native Americans and many astonishing stories , Sir Walter Raleigh tried to establish a colony called Roanoke in the land which the British named " Virginia " , in honor of Elizabeth , the Virgin Queen . The site was actually an island on North America 's eastern seaboard protected by the outer banks of what is now North Carolina 's coast . Sir Richard Grenville led the fleet that brought them to the New World , the Governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Walter Raleigh 's confidant Thomas Harriot , author of " A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia " , a chronicle of their adventure . Sir Francis Drake , who was seeking Spanish conquests in the New World , rescued this group just as they were losing control of their situation . Another colony was left at Roanoke in 1587 but by 1590 , when a long delayed supply ship finally arrived , they had disappeared without a trace . This was the so-called " Lost Colony " . A baby was born in Roanoke at this time . Little Virginia Dare , was the granddaughter of John White , the appointed Governor of the " Lost Colony " , and was probably the first English baby born in the New World . Sir Walter Raleigh sent ships to America to search for the colonists but they were unsuccessful . By the time the next English settlers arrived in North America to colonize Jamestown it was nearly twenty years later and , although several attempts were made to find out what happened to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully explained . <p> Based on George Weymouth 's accounts of voyages to the New England area in 1606 , two private companies were formed to seek a patent for colonization on the Atlantic Coast . One of these companies was called the London Company and it was given the southern Virginia territory . The other company was called the Plymouth Company and its patent was for northern Virginia . Both companies quickly sought to exercise their patents but the London Company was the first to actually place colonists on the shore . In 1607 , 105 London Company sponsored settlers arrived from England to begin the story that we all remember from our school days . Since they were there representing England and its King , James I , they settled in an encampment they called Jamestown on a river they named the James River . <p> The first year was devastating for the colonists , with only 32 colonists surviving the winter and only then because Native Americans living in the area came to their aid with food . After a supply ship arrived the next year they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once again , over the winter , most of the colonists died of starvation and from hostile encounters with their neighbors . As winter came to a close , ships arrived , and most of them were ready to leave . But as they were leaving , Lord Thomas de la Warr ( Delaware is named after him ) arrived from England with new supplies and more settlers . He refused to let the survivors return to England . Slowly , as they reached agreements with the local Native American tribes and they learned how to grow some of their own crops , the colony began to prosper . <p> Most of those original Jamestown settlers were after profit , mainly riches in the form of gold and other precious metals . They had not given enough thought to the perils that they would face in this unknown land . One of the settlers , however , was familiar with hardship and was committed to Jamestown 's survival . Capt . John Smith was a soldier and adventurer . He had fought in France and Hungary , been captured and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the other colonists ( he arrived in Jamestown in chains after alienating the leaders of the expedition ) he eventually made contact with the local Native American chieftain Powhatan , who provided the colonists with much of their food in that first year . Capt . Smith was eventually even appointed leader of the colony . <p> One of Powhatan 's children , a daughter called Pocahontas , visited the colonists in the early years and even brought food and other provisions to them . Several years later in an attempt to obtain bargaining advantage over Powhatan the colonists kidnapped Pocahontas and she stayed with them in Jamestown . A colonist , John Rolfe ( who incidentally was the first of the colonists to cultivate commercial quality tobacco and start the Colony on its way towards profitability ) eventually married her and took her to England . She died as they were preparing to return to Virginia . <p> In 1619 a group of 20 African slaves arrived in Jamestown on a Dutch ship . <p> Grouped with the Southern Colonies , Virginia started out as a Corporate colony ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have governing rights ) but in 1624 became a Royal colony ( subject to the governing authority of the granting Royalty ) . <p> In 1676 the village of Jamestown was nearly destroyed during " Bacon 's Rebellion . " <p> In 1788 Virginia was the tenth state to ratify the Constitution and recommended the Bill of Rights be added . <p> In 1607 , about the same time as the Jamestown colonization , a group of English colonists attempted to establish a colony in the Northern Virginia territory . The colony , a fort named Fort St. George , was located in present day Maine and was named Popham after its leader George Popham . It lasted for approximately a year before the discouraged settlers returned to England . <p> The Pilgrims were the first English colonists to permanently settle in New England in what we now know as Massachusetts . On Sept. 16 , 1620 the ship " Mayflower " set off from Plymouth , England on it journey to the New World . There were 102 passengers on the Mayflower including 41 Christian Puritan Separatists known collectively as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exiled from the English Church , the Puritans were seeking a new life of religious freedom in America . All 102 of the passengers were referred to as the " Pilgrims " after they arrived . The group had obtained a Patent from the London Virginia Company which indentured them into service for the Company for seven years after they arrived and settled . To prepare for their life in America , they had sought advice from people who had already visited the New World . Among their advisors was Captain John Smith who , earlier , had helped found Jamestown for the Virginia Company . It took sixty six days to reach New England and the journey was very hard for these non-seafarers . When they arrived they anchored off the tip of Cape Cod , in an area now known as Massachusetts , and before they even set foot on shore they wrote , and all the men signed , an agreement called the " Mayflower Compact " that would set the rules to guide them through the early , hard times of establishing a new community . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( modern date , see note below. ) , served as the official Constitution of the Plymouth Colony for many years . <p> For nearly a month they explored , by foot and in boats , the area around Cape Cod using the maps they had obtained in England . During their exploration they had a few minor encounters with the local natives . Finally , on December 21 , they decided on a location near Plymouth Harbor which they named Plymouth . Nearly half of the colonists and crew died from illnesses that first winter as they struggled to build their town . The following spring they were visited by a local Wampanoag native named Samoset who , surprisingly , spoke some broken English . Eventually he introduced the settlers to another native named Squanto who 's village had occupied the area before the Pilgrims arrived . Squanto had been kidnapped by English explorers and while he was in Europe the rest of his people had all been killed by diseases brought by European explorers . Squanto spoke English very well and he stayed with the Pilgrims and taught them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new country . He also played a very big part in bringing the Pilgrims and the local native population together , leading , eventually to a long , but restless , peace . <p> Not long after the Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth ( 1628 ) the Puritans came to Massachusetts and settled Naumkeag ( later called Salem ) . John Winthrop , carrying the Massachusetts Bay Charter , arrived in 1630 and founded Boston . Maine was annexed to Massachusetts in 1652 and later the Plymouth Colony was too . <p> The relationship between the Native tribes and the colonists in New England was always strained but generally did n't result in much bloodshed . In 1637 colonists , with the cooperation of several local tribes , mounted a devastating attack on a tribe known as the Pequots and then , in 1675 , the long accord that had existed between the New England colonists and the local native tribes came apart in a bloody war known as King Phillip 's War after the leader of the Wampanoag tribe , Metacomet , who was also known by his English nickname " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wampanoag leader who had originally greeted the Plymouth settlers . <p> Massachusetts was a New England colony which started out as a Corporate colony but became a Royal colony in 1691 <p> In 1623 two groups of English settlers , sent by Captain John Mason , arrived in what is now called New Hampshire ( after John Masons home County of Hampshire ) and established a fishing village near the mouth of the Piscataqua River . New Hampshire would remain an English colony throughout the colonial period even though , at various times , it came under Massachusetts jurisdiction . Note from the webmaster : Thanks to an alert reader , this is newly added information for New Hampshire ( 11/03/05 ) . <p> In 1638 , John Wheelwright , banished from Boston for defending his sister-in-law Anne Hutchinson , founded a settlement called Exeter in New Hampshire .

These men intended to profit from real estate sales . The new grant was named New Jersey for Carteret , who was governor of the Isle of Jersey . <p> One of the Middle Colonies , New Jersey started out as a Proprietary colony but in 1702 it was granted a Royal charter <p> Although the Dutch West India Co. explored and began to settle the New York area as early as 1614 , the principal occupation of the area did not occur until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread to other areas in the region .

The settlement and fort on the island became known as New Amsterdam which eventually became the City of New York . The Dutch holdings in the area were collectively called New Netherlands and included areas of what is now New Jersey . New Amsterdam was granted self government and incorporated by the Dutch in 1653 . <p> In 1664 , after King Charles II decided to reclaim the territory between Virginia and New England , Peter Stuyvesant surrendered to English forces and New Amsterdam was given to the King 's brother , the Duke of York , and renamed New York .

Lord Baltimore wanted very much to see the Colony become a reality and his son Cecil saw to it that the new Colony was settled . In 1633 the first group of settlers set sail for Maryland to establish a colony of freemen led by Leonard Calvert , Cecil Calvert 's younger brother . <p> While scattered Europeans began to settle the area as early as 1620 , the first permanent settlement was n't established until 1636 . In 1635 Roger Williams was driven from Salem , Massachusetts for espousing religious and political freedom . After spending the winter with the Indians he finally bought land from the Narragansett Indians and settled in what is now called Providence . The new colony became a haven for those seeking religious freedom . <p> In 1638 , Anne Hutchinson , having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A New England Colony , Rhode Island was established as a Corporate colony and received a Royal " Charter of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations " in 1663 .

Soon English settlers began to arrive in the area from Massachusetts . In 1636 , after being driven from Massachusetts , Clergyman Thomas Hooker and his followers arrived in Hartford and declared freedom from all save Divine Authority .

It was these Swedish settlers that brought the log cabin design to America . <p> In 1655 the Dutch gained control of the land from the Swedish . In 1664 the English obtained Delaware after defeating the Dutch . The Dutch briefly recaptured Delaware in 1673 but in 1674 the English finally took control .

In 1691 Albermarle , the northern Carolina region , was officially recognized by the English crown . This is the first time the " North Carolina " designation was used . <p> One of the Southern Colonies , North Carolina started out as a Proprietary colony but obtained a Royal charter in 1729 from George II . <p> After agreeing to the first 12 amendments , in 1789 , North Carolina became the 12th state to ratify the new Constitution . <p> South Carolina was the site of the first European settlement in North America .

The party returned to Hispanolia after suffering many deaths due to fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created the colony of Carolina ( named for King Charles II ) by granting the territory , of what is now roughly North Carolina , South Carolina and Georgia , to loyal supporters . This colonial charter was challenged by many Virginians who had settled in Albermarle Sound and resented their inclusion in the Carolina Charter . Charleston ( originally Charles Town after the King ) was founded in 1670 by a group of 200 colonists from English Barbados . The leader of the colonists was Sir John Yeamans , a powerful plantation owner on Barbados . <p> One of the Southern Colonies , South Carolina started out as a Proprietary colony but also became a Royal colony in 1719 . <p> In 1788 South Carolina was the eighth state to ratify the Constitution . <p> As early as 1647 , settlement occured on what is now Pennsylvania soil by Swedish , Dutch and English settlers in the Delaware River region .

I get a couple of emails a month challenging one or another of the dates I have listed on this page . Most of the time it is a typical question of pinpointing an event far in the past . But sometimes the date seems very clear and still there is confusion in the references . I think I can shed a little light on some of the confusion . Today we all use a calendar called the Gregorian calendar . The official adoption of the Gregorian calendar by Pope Gregory was in 1582 but many countries ( especially non-Catholic countries ) did not adopt it until much later and continued to use the Julian calendar that dated back to Julius Caesar 's time . The Gregorian calendar was not adopted in England until 1752 ( and that includes the United States because it was an English colony at the time ) so the date on the Mayflower Compact ( November 11 , 1620 ) , for instance , was based on the Julian calendar .

The End of the Wild is also a call to action . Without intervention , the surviving ecosystems we depend on for a range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail and the global spread of invasive species ( pests , parasites , and disease-causing weedy species ) could explode . If humanity is to survive , Meyer argues , we have no choice but to try to manage the fine details . We must move away from the current haphazard strategy of protecting species in isolation and create trans-regional " meta-reserves , " designed to protect ecosystem functions rather than species-specific habitats . <h> About the Author <p> The late Stephen M. Meyer was a professor of Political Science at MIT . In 2005 he was awarded the Francis W. Sargent Conservation Award by the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife . <h> Reviews <p> " Meyer blends factual evidence with expressive prowess in such a way that his ideas can not fail to make an impression .

##292652 <h> Anthony Westbury : There has to be a better way to hold elections <p> As a nation , we 're collectively exhausted . Our presidential elections have degenerated into an obscene mess of money , personal attacks and negativism . <p> There simply has to be a better way , does n't there ? <p> Here are some thoughts along those lines . Fixing the problems would take a lot of effort , but we need to start thinking about it now if we 're not to be bombarded even worse next time around -- which could be in as little as 24 short months , if past experience is any guide . <p> Which brings me to the first problem : Our presidential campaigns are simply too long . No other developed country has anything close to our multiyear campaigning , go-rounds of primaries and so on . <p> In Canada , while the length of election campaigns can vary , the Election Act sets the minimum campaign at 36 days . That 's right , the minimum . The longest ever , in 1926 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't need to set upper limits . <p> In Australia , the length of the election process is usually 68 days start to finish . <p> In Britain , the timing and length of a general election campaign is up to the sitting prime minister , but it 's usually over in a matter of weeks . However , longer is n't necessarily better . In 1997 , John Major decided to embark on a campaign lasting five months . He lost in a landslide to Tony Blair 's Labour Party . <p> So , why do we drag it out for years ? Part of the argument is that this is such a large country that candidates need to travel the length and breadth of it to speak to as many voters as possible . And that takes enormous amounts of cash , so we have a campaign finance system that seems to be getting looser each election . <p> The high amount of money that permeates the American political system may have eroded public trust in the system , a University of Wisconsin study suggested in 2009 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unresponsive to their needs . <p> America has one of the lowest turnout rates of any developed country . Even during the euphoria of 2008 , figures hovered only at about 60 percent . In contrast Denmark , a country that has much shorter , less expensive campaigns and prohibits TV campaign ads , had an 87 percent turnout rate in recent elections . And , in case you were wondering , it 's a democracy where no one is forced to the polls . <p> As the current presidential campaign has illustrated only too well , throwing money at the problem tends to make things a lot worse . <p> Case in point , the U.S. Supreme Court 's 2010 Citizen 's United decision , which allowed groups to contribute as much money as they want to campaigns , should go down as the most financially disastrous reading of law ever . Presidents now spend as much time campaigning as they do governing . It 's deadening voters ' ability to connect with the issues , making many of us declare " Who cares who wins ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length of campaigns or restricting how much money can be spent on them would also reduce the likelihood of having an enlightened and informed electorate . <p> Yet I have to ask , did n't we reach a point of no return with all the attack ads , lying and half-truths ? Was n't there a point where their shock value simply evaporated and we turned off ? In the future , some academic will analyze the exact moment when the ads ceased to have any effect on viewers . If they can quantify it , perhaps we 'll eventually get some relief . At this point in the game , how many undecided voters were left anyway ? <p> The Republicans and Democrats spent a combined total of more than $2 billion on this presidential campaign , a shameful record . Hundreds of millions more were spent by PACS and other special-interest groups . <p> What else could we have bought with $2 billion ? <p> Well , more than 3 million shares of Apple stock ( and then we might actually have come out ahead ) , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars -- only another half billion dollars more needed to complete the 140 million-mile trip . <p> We could have given every one of the 311.6 million men , women and children in America an extra $6.42 to spend . Or we could have given the 66.3 million people in the nine swing states so disproportionately hit with TV hate ads an extra $30.17 in compensation . Think of the boost to the economy that could have had . <p> I do n't know which I 'd choose , but spending it on hate ads most of us want only to forget seems an incredible waste of time , effort and money . <p> Let 's hope we will do better -- a lot better -- next time . Get your thinking caps on quickly , the next election campaign is only just beyond the horizon . <p> Anthony Westbury is a columnist for Scripps Treasurer Coast Newspapers . This column reflects 
##296251 <h> Stratospheric valuations for social media titans assume vast advertising revenue that will never arrive <p> First thing you do , tear this article out of the magazine and carefully set it on fire . It 's about the jockeying for position and revenue among the big players in social media : Facebook , Twitter , and Google 's YouTube . And the analysis is n't bad for -- whaddyacallit -- history . But it was n't written in the past 12 minutes . So more likely than not it 's already hilariously out of date . ( " Google ? " you may be asking , perplexed . In case the brand has in the interim disappeared from the scene , like Webvan and John Tesh , listen up : " Google " was a search engine . ) <p> Probably there 's a new serial-killer app in town -- CatRattle.com , or some such -- that lets users know what everybody else really thinks of them , in real time . Probably sweeping the nation is the phrase " Dude , you 've been totally rattled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mockery out of this exercise , let 's try to address three basic questions : <p> 1 . If you build it and they come , does that guarantee that there 's money to be made ? ( Hint : No . ) <p> 2 . Which of Facebook , YouTube , and Twitter will amass the millennium 's first megafortune and a borderless virtual state , with a vast population , political influence , economic clout , and a lair in a hollowed-out volcano from which to control the world 's weather ? ( Well , you can probably eliminate Twitter . ) <p> 3 . The Wall Street valuations of companies like Facebook , which is worth US $85 billion on the secondary market , are stratospheric . Should we stockpile ammo and canned goods for when the bubble bursts ? ( Not a bad idea ; remember Pets.com . ) <p> Once again , addressing such questions is a process both complicated and highly speculative . But let 's give it a shot anyway , beginning with a glance at the status quo , and a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. advertisers spent $25 billion online in 2010 -- representing about 15 percent of the $164 billion U.S. ad market and , for the first time , a bit more than their spending on print newspapers . That was no small milestone . But here 's the thing : According to eMarketer , 31 percent of Americans ' media-consuming time in 2010 was spent online . Which means , speaking broadly , marketers valued new-media time only half as much as old-media time . And that 's the rose-colored view . Chris Anderson , curator of the TED Conferences , recently crunched numbers from Nielsen , Forrester Research , the Yankee Group , and other modelers to synthesize the value , medium by medium , of an individual 's time . Globally , print publications fetched $1 per hour of reader attention . TV got a quarter for a viewer hour . Online fetched " less than a dime . " <p> Why is online advertising such a poor stepchild ? Well , extremely delightful and informative books with pale-blue and white covers have been written on this subject , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless supply of online content means an endless supply of places where ads could go , which by definition depresses demand and , with it , price . Period . <p> The second problem is more basic still . Ever click on a banner ad ? Have you ? Ever ? Of course not , because why would you leave what you 're doing -- especially socializing -- to go listen to a sales pitch ? The click-through rate , industry-wide , is less than 1 percent -- and chalk some of that up to mouse error and click fraud . Some advertisers deal with this problem by popping ads into your face , blaring audio , or subjecting you to " preroll " video messages before the video you actually wish to see . As Anderson sagely observed to a Madison Avenue audience , that was an acceptable quid pro quo in the days of passive TV viewing . Online , though , users are active and in control . " If you take control away from them , " he said , " they will hate you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is spam . These two structural problems leave two possibilities : Either advertising will never be the force in new media that it was in the five predigital centuries ( a theory to which I personally subscribe ) , or someone will crack the code . <p> The holy grail , if it exists , resides in online advertising 's central advantage : the ability to mine data and target individuals with an offer relevant to their lives and interests . In the case of social networks , there is also the ability to target friends of existing customers -- what venture capitalist David Pakman calls " the most powerful form of advertising ever created , not counting search . " Not only is such targeted advertising on average twice as lucrative as conventional ads , it can fetch 100 times as much revenue as mere spam , the sort that pushes random teeth-whitening miracles and predatory-loan-shilling dancing silhouettes . That 's why Pakman believes Facebook 's valuation will rise even higher . <p> " Social networking is a winner-take-all market , " Pakman says . " They run the table @ @ @ @ @ @

History , culture , politics , economics , news and the general weirdness that usually floats down from the north . <h> To the point <p> 11 August 2011 <p> When you 're writing for something called the " TransBorder Project of the Center for International Policy " I suppose it 's natural to fall into bureaucratic prose ( full of references to " DTOs " -- " Drug Trafficking Organizations " , or what the real world calls narcos -- and such ) . But , Tom Barry at least has the patience to read through documents like the White House 's July release of a " Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime " -- which , as Barry points out -- is a " strategy without strategic planning " , and seems to involve shoving old whines into new acronyms . And justifying plain old violent reactionary measures as something new and bloodless sounding . <p> The Obama administration is blessedly free of the alarmism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and military occupations during the Bush administration . However , the Obama White House 's newly expressed determination to combat the rise of transnational crime suffers from the same type of exaggerations , moral imperatives , factual deficits , and ahistorical threat assessments that fueled Bush 's misbegotten global war on terrorism . <p> Dressing up the drug war in the framework of transnational threats and international cooperation represents a failure of vision .

But first , let 's just do a little GMO 101 . . . <p> A genetically modified organism ( GMO , also called ? genetically engineered ? ) is a plant , animal or microorganism ( eg , bacteria ) that is created by means that overcome natural boundaries . Genetic engineering involves crossing species that could not cross in nature . <p> If you have n't heard about Genetically Modified Organisms ( GMOs ) or Genetically Engineered ( GE ) foods or Monsanto ' s role in all of this , I hate to be the one to rupture your bubble , but this is a big issue and we all need to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer or bioengineer , but I am a foodie . I love food and have been in love with sustainable agriculture concepts and practices since the 80s . I 'm also not a news journalist and do n't pretend to be one , so I 'll be clear about my opinion right up front -- I prefer to NOT to eat GMO/GE foods , and I doubt anyone could convince me otherwise . <p> Host , Green Diva Meg ( aka low-stress , green lifestyle doyen , Megan McWilliams ) , her sidekick Green Dude Scott ( aka Scotty Rousseau ) and a variety of Green Diva Correspondents throughout the US offer information on green or sustainable living from a guilt-free , low-stress perspective on their weekly , one-hour internet-based radio broadcast .

She 's a very talented and intelligent woman and I wish her and her project all the very best . I hope it 's a huge success and people take heed ! Monsanto=evil . <p> Thanks to everyone for your comments and supports . I am one of the producers working on this film and we are in the home stretch of our campaign . Only 10 days left to go .

##302252 <h> Why did many colonists feel that they were not being treated fairly by Britains ? <p> Actually as a whole the colonists were pretty happy with the King and felt they were British . When the king began to over step his authority that is where the problem came from . The king saw the colonies as spoiled children that were having a temper tantrum so he treated them as such . If he had been less hard handed I think the revolution would n't have happened or it would have fizzled out . Our history has a lot of myths concerning this time . An example of this is the myth of high tea taxes . The tax on tea was lowered , but the men who smuggled in Dutch tea were unhappy because the cost of their tea was higher than the British when

Kristol " totally disagrees " : <p> The third choice is basically the status quo . <p> Check out his defensive body language . Millions of people with no rights ?

The problem is when liberals run along , like they did for the Iraq war . In the case of Iran , liberal opposition is much more severe , hence the real debate , hence Kristol &; co can not dominate the debate because liberals , esp Jewish liberals , wont give them the same cover . <p> The problem is people like Ben-Ami who cling to Beinart 's fantasy visions of " It 's All Bibi 's Fault " when all evidence show that it were the Labor/Kadima parties which historically stood for most of the settlements/war and aggressions . <p> But before we get to that discussion ; is there any video of the full debate ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of assets . They are the people who run the country . Conservative/liberal is just a show . Capital is in charge . Labour can forget it . It has been like this since morning in America , 1980 . <p> Status quo has been Israel 's preference for 20 years ( apart from adjusting the status quo by grabbing more Area " C " land every day ) . And why not ? The international community can not be bothered to ACT ( even when Israel " tests " them by demolishing millions of $$ worth of structures they paid for they merely say words , such as " tsk , tsk " ) . <p> Ben ami talks about the scenario over " the next few generations " but israel does not have that sort of time . kristol is a joke . the Weekly standard wo n't expect everything to work out if the US debt issue is left at the status quo. life is different , except for israel . Sure it is . <p> They are going to have to reconsider most of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just acting on the political reality the exile to Babylon- it was a win win situation purim- the Jews have to see it from the point of view of the Persian economy of the time <p> Of course , the problem with Zionism is that the whole premise starts with , " What 's good for the goose is not good for the gander . Because we 're the chosen gander . " ( Always convenient for colonizers to think of themselves that way -- Manifest Destiny , anyone ? ) <p> I 've heard " centrist " Zionist friends say very bluntly , " ' Never again ' means never again for the Jews , full stop , " and " Yes , I would kill 1,000 gentiles if it would save one Jew . " <p> I do n't even want to repeat what I 've heard right-wing Zionists say to my face . There 's no other class of people I associate with who feel free to express such opinions in public . It 's baffling . <p> Annie : That settler attack -- there 's three videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter single video in the Guardian : link to guardian.co.uk Of course , the Grauni piece aims for ' balance ' by decontextualising and implying village stone throwers had some ' blame ' . <p> This is important progress . I remember well just a few short years back arguing with the Zionists that Israel was destroying the two-state solution and they kept on coming back with their support for that outcome and it was only up to the Palestinians to become a little more reasonable . They seemed so sincere . <p> Now it is honestly out there -- one-state for Jews and some vague solution for the Palestinian problem . They have not yet decided on second class citizenship ( do n't call it apartheid ! ) or the transfer option ( do n't call it ethnic cleansing ! ) . Now the only democracy in the ME will have a public discussion on which of these two solutions it will be . Let the debate begin . <p> Ben Ami seems to me to be following a pattern I have observed in quite a few whose understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something about the Zionist narrative does n't add up . <p> From his position expressed here , it is a short journey to understanding that the only possible justification for a " Jewish State " is the " barbarity of the other " . <p> Given what is now known about the barbarity exhibited by the Yishuv ( and subsequent Israeli administration ) , this justification falls away and leaves naked racism exposed . <p> It is a journey many of us have made . Perhaps Ben Ami will catch up soon . <p> I have n't watched the video yet . I believe the status quo is not sustainable over the long run . To a political apparatchik ( which is essentially what Kristol fils is ) the long run has to be less than 12 years to even register on his radar screen . Anything more than that is strictly for think tanks and not for serious political discourse . <p> And the fourth choice is basically -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Robert Carneiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the number of autonomous political units in the world was 200,000 in the year 500 . Now it 's fewer than 200 units . Carneiro estimated that after A.D. 2,300 there will be only one state for the entire globe . -- Well I do n't kow , whether that will be the case . <p> But from a longer historical perspective , there is little chance for a political unit like Israel to survive the general trend . Nor does a two state solution . <p> - As I have said before . I like to quantify things -- just for the hell of it . <p> I 'm not sure if this is naivete , or perhaps wishful thinking aka. confirmation bias ( the natural tendency of humans to favor information that fits one 's one beliefs ) but what Kristol is saying is very simple : The state of Israel is not going to become minority Jewish ( ! ) You guys are dismissing this claim by Kristol because of what it entails . <p> This is not disagreement about facts , as Ben-Ami puts it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , can change . If anything , out of the three options : 1SS , 2SS , 1S-Apartheid -- Ben-Ami 's 2SS is the least realistic . From a realpolitik perspective . <p> Kristol is basically saying that Israel will do whatever is necessary to keep a Jewish majority within Israel . ie. keep the " status quo " apartheid regime until Israel has been ethnically cleansed of Arabs . At which point it may well give all its remaining subjects equal rights and become , de facto , Jewish and democratic . <p> I agree about what you say Krystol implies . Been harping on this very point for some time now , but everyone around seems intent on wearing their rose colored glasses . That is , when not shaking fists and sharing their rage at whatever latest atrocity israel commits . I wish people would finally process that Israel has no intention of " absorbing " the West Bank Palestinians , just as they had no intention of absorbing the Gazans . Just think -- what does it really meas that gaza is allowed to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is standing by , doing nothing . To Israel it means one thing only -- that they got away with " it " . Which , in turn , means that gaza is exactly what 's planned for those Palestinians who stay in the West Bank . Not batustans , and certainly not a mini-state . And Israel will never ever allow any kind of equal rights movement and will do whatever it feels it must to stop it . <p> I have to laugh when I hear people admonishing against all out BDS because it 'll make the Israelis " even more " intransigent . As if there 's any intention -- ever -- to have any dialogue ; as if a " dialogue " is still possible -- in any israeli 's book ( not just the governments they elect ) , ie , anyone other than those few thousand leftists and activists who keep on fighting their fights , pretending that their numbers can somehow , mysteriously grow . <p> People -- even the most well meaning leftists here -- should think long and hard about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . That Israel suffered no official repercussions for cast lead , which was an atrocity by any measure . A massacre is what it was as congress supported Israel , meaning the US congress and president(s) support massacres and atrocities . Even as Europe made some lame noises then looked away . And the Turkish activists were murdered on the high seas by Israeli pirates , and Turkey still did not break diplomatic relations with israel . In fact they are kind of collaborating now -- at the behest of the US and Saudi Arabia -- on bringing Syria down . And flotillas were stopped in their tracks despite the preparations and the publicity . And when israel wanted flytilla activists to be held off flights , the European airlines go along , and there 's hardly a murmur from any capital . <p> To me , the only question that remains is what can be done to put pressure enough on israel and israelis that they will figure out there 's a price to pay . BDS against anything and everything associated with israel is the least of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to entertain any and all ideas of what can tame the monster that America and Europe beget through deliberate impotence . <p> Danaa Your words are right on point . Its sad that the wonderful Mondoweiss contributers still have this utopian , idealistic view that somehow Israel , the Zionist vision that their leaders have espoused since its " birth " , will change its policies , toward the Palestinians . If the Israeli govt. and its leaders would have it , not one Palestinian will remain in " Eretz Israel " . This slow genocide , ethnic cleansing of all Palestinians is , to them , the only way to complete the Project " A " pure " Jewish State , the Zionist vision that encompasses , tragically , the vast majority of Israelis . Of course that is said only privately , in safe quarters , among themselves . Mondoweiss must confront the the utter disdain that Israeli 's have for anyone suggesting that Palestinians have " human rights " , God forbid , Right to Return , right to Self Determination . Wallow as a slave Dayan or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest level of " Goyim " , die , or leave . Israeli Jewish racism can never be discussed or applied to the analysias of the I/P situation . <p> Israeli Jewish racism can never be discussed or applied to the analysias of the I/P situation . <p> i du n no , seems to me like we 've discussed it a lot . <p> Its sad that the wonderful Mondoweiss contributers still have this utopian , idealistic view that somehow Israel , the Zionist vision that their leaders have espoused since its " birth " , will change its policies , toward the Palestinians . <p> i do not think there is a uniform vision of our contributors . many of them probably think there is an israeli policy of " slow genocide , ethnic cleansing of all Palestinians .... to complete the Project " A " pure " Jewish State " <p> " I wish people would finally process that Israel has no intention of " absorbing " the West Bank Palestinians , just as they had no intention of absorbing the Gazans . Just think -- what does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an internment camp , indefinitely , as the world is standing by , doing nothing . To Israel it means one thing only -- that they got away with " it " . ... Danaa <p> I totally agree . If one ca n't look at year by year by year of 65 years of Israel and see the absolute true " nature " of zionism then they are blind or in denial . As long as the US supports Israel I think it is possible Israel can take over Palestine entirely and either transfer Palestines or make them a sub class of semi slaves . Where I think Israel will eventually end , is Palestine will not be enough for it . There is no end to their kind of messianic greed . After Palestine it will be something else and something else they want . Eventually they will go too far even for the US and have to be put down . <p> In fairness , Danaa , Cast Lead happened before the full enormity of the Great Recession became apparent . Before 9% of Americans became long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . Before Greece became a basket case , before the speculators targeted France . <p> Israel is artificial . It lives off the guilt of the West and it earns its money selling the war on terror . If the goys in charge one day decide it is not worth the effort then Israel will be in a real pickle . <p> Arnon , when I first watched the video clip , I read Kristol as saying , he did n't care how many Palestinians there are now , or ever , because nothing will make Israel give up it 's Jewish ( substantial ) majority status within the green line , it 's Jewish governing rule therein , coupled with the consequential power to assure maximum military defense of said sovereign state via use of its expanding lebensraum , ultimately in all the land known to it as Greater Israel . The status quo is the only option other than world acquiesence in official borders enveloping that land mass . <p> There 's a certain degree of sheer power-worship here which is quite horrible . However the basic idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , only Jewish people have a share in sovereignty which is theirs by right , though others may have a share by grace and generosity . So , though generosity may well be extended , nothing must happen that suggests that anyone else shares the birthright . <p> Kristol could be so nonchalant and flippant and play around with realpolitik if he spoke for a population block that ran into the hundreds of millions . Say he was Han Chinese or North Indian or white European . But his kippa says he 's Jewish . Max 7 million in the US . Super organised , punching way above their weight but 4th on the scale of peoples in the US after whites , hispanics and African americans . So a wedge rather than a block . <p> I wonder if Jews were ever so arrogant . I think the visibility of it is very troubling . These power trips do n't last . Most things revert to the mean eventually . <p> Kristol is bored with the Palestinian argument with Ben-Ami . He has other things to do that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . <p> Kristol and the Neocons ' attentions are all currently focused on ginning up the war with Iran , as that is really the key to maintaining the Israeli status quo with Palestine . If the Iran attack is off , then Apartheid Israel is naked in the wind without a figlead <p> If Kristol and the Neocons lose the Iran war -- it 's gameover for the status quo in Israel and they know it . The prize is the war in Iran -- the lid boiling over on Apartheid in Israel will just have to wait because if the Neocons do n't get Iran they have lost the whole game <p> I have n't been a big fan of J-Street or Jeremy Ben -Ami , as I see them functioning as the AIPAC-lite good cop most of the time , but he sure put Kristol on a particular silver platter this time around . <p> Who in that audience could have missed the raw stark reality of just who Kristol is and what he really wants -- ' more of the same forever or for as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ' <p> Kristol 's weakness is being exposed because he is defending such a weak and craven argument but he will continue do so past the expiration date of ' status quo Israel ' -- it 's only that he has gotten away with it for so long that he is still unembarassed enough to continue to openly embarass himself , which is exactly what he did . <p> Ad hominens aside , he looked like an overweight 4yr old who just stole his younger sibling 's toy and is refusing to give it back , and was used to never having to give anything back , that he has a special ' in ' with his parents such that he himself can get away with anything forever <p> I can just imagine his shrieks of protest as Apartheid is dismantled out from under his feet -- it will appear to him as if were living in a house of cards once it starts collapsing -- and there will be no bottom . <p> Israel is much like Kristol -- there just is no bottom to it 's crimes against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Settlers today in 2012 then you immeditely crash thru a tier of the house of cards and you 're back to ' 67 . If you expose and try to deal with the Israeli lies of ' 67 you immediately crash thru to the Israeli lies and ethnic cleansing of ' 48 , and the unholy of unholies , Right of Return as guaranteed by UN Resolutions , Int'l Law , and the Geneva Conventions . <p> Where do you stop ? The only answer Kristol and Israel have is to never begin . In desperation of the anticipated collapses , Israel has always just desperately decided to never start because there really is no stopping <p> Where it stops in reality is the One State because Israel has made sure , has guaranteed by explicit policy and choice that a 2 State Solution never be permitted -- and this is because Israelis have realized over and over again , when it really came down to it , they could never take off number of cards necessary for a Palestinian state to exist because the whole Israeli house of cards would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer has a 2 state option -- it is just her Wm Kristol-like bravado that she will try to brazen out the currrent Apartheid , as supported by her bought and paid support in the US Congress <p> There is nothing underneath Kristol except and his just desserts except a few cards and the same goes for Israel writ large <p> Bill " bloody " Kristol is drowning in the Iraqi people 's and American soldiers blood . The problem with psycho paths is that they do not notice or care . Can not stand this man . Keep in mind he went after the Clinton health care bill . " kill the bill " If the Iraqi people were ever to go after the Bush administration war criminals at the International Court of Justice ( Nuremberg type trials ) Kristol would be found complicit in war crimes and they might just say ' kill the bill " for war crimes <p> One of the biggest problems with modern Judaism is that there is no brand management . Nobody appears to be in charge . Anyone can put on a kippa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone from a bigot to a mass murderer . <p> seafoid , this has been Mooser 's mantra for ages .

He 's shown plenty of awareness and history education justifying such a stance . Mooser does not like Gilad Atzmon , but has never really explained why , if memory serves . <p> Gilad Atzmon perhaps never hurt a fly , but he proudly published a lengthy somewhat ignorant diatribe against an Israeli Jewish Marxist who was analyzing Israel and Palestinian situation using Marxist analysis , thus attacking a progressive anti-Zionist Israeli more or less for being a Jew . <p> Bill Kristol is in a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Emergency Committee for Israel that is basically a vehicle to place expensive ads .

##321850 <h> Popular This Week <h> Also Worth Reading <p> No related links for this issue category . <p> Deficit theater is coming to DC tomorrow , with a well-funded " fiscal summit . " The plot summary is that we have Deficit Trouble - Right Here In River City ! so to fix it we need to cut Social Security and Medicare and the things democracy does for We , the People -- while cutting taxes on the rich and their corporations to make us more " business-friendly . " ( This musical is sometimes billed as " Simpson-Bowles " but it 's the same old song . ) <p> Just ten years ago this country was running huge surpluses and paying off its debt . But then we elected Obama and all hell broke loose . Oh , wait ... <p> Between the time ten years ago when we had big surpluses and were paying off the debt and now when we are told the " Obama spending and deficit " mean we have to cut back on the things We , the People do for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happened , the things that changed , are being ignored in the current DC discussion about what we need to do to fix things . <h> Why We Have A Deficit <p> What happened under Bush ? We cut taxes on the rich and doubled military spending . ( And started wars . ) And do n't forget collapsing the economy , forcing people onto unemployment and food stamps . That is why we have a deficit . We have a deficit because of tax cuts for the rich , huge military budget increases and the consequences of deregulating corporations . <p> How large was the country 's yearly budget deficit and total debt in the " Eisenhower/Truman " decades when the top tax rate was 90% ? <p> Today we have an " infrastructure deficit " -- the amount needed to repair our country 's roads , bridges , sewers , etc. -- of somewhere upwards of $1.6 trillion . Was our infrastructure kept in good repair before the top tax rates were cut ? <p> Concentration of wealth is long recognized as a threat to democracy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest ever concentration of wealth going to a few at the top . Was the problem of wealth concentration increasing or decreasing before the top tax rates were cut ? <p> When top rates were high people could n't take home vast fortunes in a single year . When it took several years to make a fortune did corporations depend on long-term or short-term thinking ? Did the executives of corporations care if the infrastructure and communities their companies depended on were in good shape ? Did large corporations fleece customers and exploit employees for quarterly returns as they do now ? <p> So we know why we have a deficit , and we have realistic budget plans that undo the damage , maintain the things that democracy does for We , the People and invest in growing our economy . So why are n't these plans part of the big DC deficit discussion ? Maybe progressive plans that cut the deficit are not part of the DC deficit discussion because cutting the deficit is n't really the point . This Deficit Story Ca n't Be Repeated Often Enough ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , huge deficits . Bush said it was " incredibly positive news " when we went back into deficit spending . He said it was good news because it continued the plan to use debt to force the government to cut back . He said that . It was the plan . ( Do n't take my word for it , click the links . ) <p> The Reagan people said it too , back when they started the massive deficit spending . It was the plan : force the country into massive debt , " starve the beast , " and use that to force the government out of business , or at least to be " small enough to drown in a bathtub . " They forced the tax cuts and Reagan said this was " cutting the government 's allowance . " The point was to use revenue cutbacks to force government to shrink , to get out of the way of the 1% . <h> A Golden Oldie <p> It 's not hard to figure out why we have a huge deficit . It 's so easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some pictures : <p> Bill Clinton raised taxes on the rich . Bush cut them . <p> Now , about that huge national debt ... <p> The second chart kind of explains itself . The third chart can help you find a place to get some money : <p> ( Note : There is no more Soviet Union . ) <p> In case that is n't clear enough , try this : <p> Let me know if you still have any questions . <p> We had a budget surplus . We were paying off the debt . Then something changed . If you want to fix the deficits , change it back . <p> Do n't fall for it . Deficits were the plan . Run up the borrowing , then come back with a scare campaign that stampedes people into accepting cuts in the things democracy does for We , the People . It was the plan . <p> We welcome your comments . Please keep them civil and relevant to the post you 're commenting on . We reserve the right to remove comments that are 
##325451 <p> International Viewpoint is published under the responsibility of the Bureau of the Fourth International . Signed articles do not necessarily reflect editorial policy . Articles can be reprinted with acknowledgement , and a live link if possible . <h> " In this case you have no influence on me ... " <p> Thank you for your reply to my letter , which sheds some light on your original article ( " On the Forthcoming Election in Iraq " ) , but leaves much else in obscurity . It is clear at least that the dismay your piece caused me was , in a sense , welcome to you , since it might be a therapeutic shock , helping you to educate " sections of the Western anti-imperialist movement " , and in particular " the antiwar movement in the US and Britain " . I fear , however , that , for this member of your target audience , neither your first article nor your reply has succeeded in this pedagogic purpose . <p> You accuse me ( somewhat inconsistently , I have to say ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your analysis . The two charges are connected . The inconsistency is that , you claim , I say that it was OK to support elections in Iraq when the Iraqi masses were demanding them a year ago but not now that Bush , Blair , &; Co are supporting them . Excuse me , but can you point out where I said this , either in my letter to you or elsewhere ? The pathos you seek rhetorically to build up to expose the absurdity of the position you attribute me is a waste of words . <p> Alex Callinicos <p> What I did in my letter was to criticize your assertion that the United States is currently seeking to undermine the elections , and to argue that Bush and Blair are now adamant that the elections should take place , so that they can confer some legitimacy on the client regime they are trying to construct . You implicitly concede this point , saying that ? Bush and Blair are now trying to make the most of the elections ( with quite limited success ) ? . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite limited success ? . ) <p> You are quite right that it would be politically immature and indeed plain silly to oppose the elections just because of this shift in stance on the part of the imperialist political leadership . To repeat , nowhere do I say this . Indeed , I say that Owe have simply to accept that the Iraqi resistance remains divided over whether or not to participate in the elections1 , the implication of which is that one should accept that , in principle , participation ( on the basis of opposition to the occupation ) is , like armed resistance , a legitimate political response to the present situation . <p> You take this position as evidence that your ? arguments have apparently had an impact on my views ? . Despite my great respect for you , I 'm afraid that in this case you have had no influence on me . The Iraqi elections have been a looming issue for months , long before you wrote your piece . You further accuse me of ? declaring the forthcoming elections ? illegitimate ? , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I deny is that ? the elections will produce a legitimate democratic regime in Iraq ? . Do you think Bush and his proconsul John Negroponte will surrender control of the country to a popular assembly after the elections ? Come off it . <p> As to whether the elections themselves will be a genuine expression of the Iraqi people 's will , this is an open question . Robert Fisk is one of many to have pointed out that half the population of Iraq lives in the four provinces where the US says elections will be hard to hold . The Financial Times reports the United Nations1 concern that the elections will not be properly monitored - hardly surprising given the carnage in much of the country. ( 1 ) <p> You are very keen to discover ( in my case imaginary ) inconsistencies in others , yet your own position is hardly straightforward : ? I am not saying that the antiwar movement or the anti-imperialist left should support the elections - and still less that we should support their outcome regardless of the circumstances . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement and the left to condemn the elections in advance ? . <p> I wo n't engage in chop logic and make fun of this rather tortuous formulation , because I recognize that the situation in Iraq is complex and dynamic , and that the demands we pose should reflect this . I think you should extend this courtesy to others . <p> Where I do get a little irritated is when , apropos of Zarqawi , you claim that I refrained from such an explicit condemnation of the atrocities committed by Zarqawi1s group until such a vicious campaign was launched against your party and the antiwar coalition you have so effectively built and led in Britain , by some right-wingers in the trade-union movement who seized on the pretext of the atrocious torture and murder of Iraqi Communist Party member and trade unionist Hadi Salih . <p> This assertion is both false and mischievous . The Stop the War Coalition is much broader , at every level from its national officers downwards , than the Socialist Workers Party ( to which I belong ) . Rightly , as I pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a stand for or against the armed resistance and campaigns for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Iraq . It is therefore not primarily its responsibility to take a position on this or that armed action by Iraqi groups , but rather to denounce and help to bring an end to the much larger violence being perpetrated by the US , Britain , and its allies . <p> Nevertheless , the Stop the War Coalition , did , for example , together with the Muslim Association of Britain , issue a statement in September 2004 calling for the immediate release of the British hostage Kenneth Bigley , who was later killed by Zarqawi 's group . The statement specifically states : ? It is not possible to condone the kidnapping , still less execution , of hostages. ? ( 2 ) In June 2004 , Michael Berg , father of Zarqawi1s first Western victim , travelled specially to London to speak to a Coalition protest . As for myself , speaking on behalf of the SWP at one of the largest plenaries at the European Social Forum in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zarqawi . So , here again , my ? shift in attitude ? is a pure invention . <p> You know perfectly well the political context in which the row over Salih 's murder has unfolded in Britain . The Communist Party of Iraq , which controls the Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions ( IFTU ) , has ( as you acknowledge in a footnote ) supported the occupation from the start and participated in Paul Bremer 's Quisling ? Governing Council ' . At the Labour Party conference last October an IFTU leader spoke from the platform successfully to help persuade the delegates to vote down a resolution calling for a date to be set for British withdrawal from Iraq . In doing so he gave cover to the leaders of the main trade unions , allowing them to help Blair out a hole , and in the process to violate the troops out policy of their own unions and of the Trade Union Congress . <p> It was when the Stop the War Coalition criticized the IFTU for its role at the Labour Party conference and for its collaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notably the largest , UNISON , which has provided offices for the IFTU in its headquarters ) launched an assault on the Coalition . This campaign has been fuelled by the disruption by some sectarian idiots of an ESF plenary where an IFTU representative had ( mistakenly ) been invited to speak , and now by Salih 's murder . <p> Of course , the IFTU1s collaborationist role does n't for a moment justify torturing and killing Salih . But it is important to distinguish sharply between condemning atrocities such as this and supporting a ? union ? whose ? Communist ? leaders simultaneously benefit from Saddam1s authoritarian trade-union law and acquiesce in the occupation 's illegal attempt to remake Iraqi society along neo-liberal lines . And where were hypocrites like the British pro-war columnists Nick Cohen and Johann Hari who have waxed so indignant over Salih1s killing when the US Marines were storming Falluja ? <p> Of course you know all this , but the point is an important one - Salih 's assassination is being used to split one of the most important antiwar groups in the US , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to misrepresent the attitude of supporters of the Stop the War Coalition towards thugs like Zarqawi is - once again - not helpful . If you dislike my criticism that sometimes you veer too close to the official Anglo-American rhetoric you should choose your words with more care . <p> In some ways , however , important though all these issues are , they are secondary to the main point , which is your ambivalent attitude towards the armed resistance to the occupation . You insist that you consider some attacks ? legitimate ? , but in a footnote you say : ? I do believe the first Palestinian Intifada with its mass demonstrations and stone throwing was much more effective than the second than the second one with its resort to firearms and suicide attacks . This does not mean that the armed actions in Iraq are ineffective ; they are effective , much more so than in Palestine. ? <p> Your position then seems to be that you would prefer it if Iraqis took part in peaceful mass demonstrations , but you acknowledge that armed struggle , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's important to distinguish one1s preferences from realities . I would prefer to see in Iraq the kind of mass movement that developed during the Revolution of 1958 , whose history has been so magnificently reconstructed by your friend Hanna Batatu. ( 3 ) Indeed , I would prefer mass strikes and workers ' and peasants ' councils ( a little Utopian perhaps , given that unemployment is 70% plus ) . But the reality is that it is classical guerrilla warfare waged by a variety of political forces , most of them very far ideologically from the two of us , that has brought the occupation to its present plight . <p> The elections - wrested from the US by the demonstrations a year ago - have contributed to this crisis , but are not at the heart of it . The reason why armed struggle is more effective in Iraq than in Palestine is very simple . The Palestinians confront a settler state with a mass base and a heavily armed citizen army that leaves them outnumbered in Israel and the Occupied Territories . In Iraq a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million that , outside the Kurdish areas , overwhelmingly rejects their presence . This is a recipe for defeat for the US - not , of course , military defeat in open battle , but the remorseless attrition of the political will of the occupying powers to remain . <p> This is why the Shia card is so important to them . The worst moment for Bush so far came in April last year , when Bremer foolishly launched an offensive on two fronts - against Falluja in the Sunni Triangle and against the Sadrists in Baghdad and the south . After making the necessary retreat , the Americans ( perhaps learning from their British predecessors , who were masters of this kind of imperial tactic ) adopted a salami strategy - attacking Sadr in August and then Falluja in November in an effort to eliminate piecemeal the most maximalist centres of resistance to the occupation . <p> This strategy has been facilitated by Sistani , the key figure in the Shia establishment . He used the Najaf crisis in August to sideline Sadr , his most important political rival among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattened . I wonder why you don1t respond to what I said about this in my earlier letter . I also wonder what you think about the apparent retreat by the electoral list endorsed by Sistani from demanding an American pull-out after the election . The Financial Times reports : <p> ? The United Iraqi Alliance , bringing together the country 's main Shia Islamist parties , also included a call for the negotiation of a withdrawal timetablle .

##329152 <p> 511 . Answer to Dept 's 284 , Feb 3 13 involves questions so intricate , so delicate , so strange to our form of thought , and so important to analysis of our international environment that I can not compress answers into single brief message without yielding to what I feel would be dangerous degree of over-simplification . I hope , therefore , Dept will bear with me if I submit in answer to this question five parts , subjects of which will be roughly as follows : <p> ( 1 ) Basic features of post-war Soviet outlook . <p> ( 2 ) Background of this outlook <p> ( 3 ) Its projection in practical policy on official level . <p> ( 4 ) Its projection on unofficial level . <p> ( 5 ) Practical deductions from standpoint of US policy . <p> I apologize in advance for this burdening of telegraphic channel ; but questions involved are of such urgent importance , particularly in view of recent events , that our answers to them , if they deserve attention at all , seem to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) USSR still lives in antagonistic " capitalist encirclement " with which in the long run there can be no permanent peaceful coexistence . As stated by Stalin in 1927 to a delegation of American workers : <p> " In course of further development of international revolution there will emerge two centers of world significance : a socialist center , drawing to itself the countries which tend toward socialism , and a capitalist center , drawing to itself the countries that incline toward capitalism . Battle between these two centers for command of world economy will decide fate of capitalism and of communism in entire world . " <p> ( b ) Capitalist world is beset with internal conflicts , inherent in nature of capitalist society . These conflicts are insoluble by means of peaceful compromise . Greatest of them is that between England and US . <p> ( d ) Intervention against USSR , while it would be disastrous to those who undertook it , would cause renewed delay in progress of Soviet socialism and must therefore be forestalled at all costs . <p> ( e ) Conflicts between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nevertheless hold out great possibilities for advancement of socialist cause , particularly if USSR remains militarily powerful , ideologically monolithic and faithful to its present brilliant leadership . <p> ( f ) It must be borne in mind that capitalist world is not all bad . In addition to hopelessly reactionary and bourgeois elements , it includes ( 1 ) certain wholly enlightened and positive elements united in acceptable communistic parties and ( 2 ) certain other elements ( now described for tactical reasons as progressive or democratic ) whose reactions , aspirations and activities happen to be " objectively " favorable to interests of USSR These last must be encouraged and utilized for Soviet purposes . <p> ( g ) Among negative elements of bourgeois-capitalist society , most dangerous of all are those whom Lenin called false friends of the people , namely moderate-socialist or social-democratic leaders ( in other words , non-Communist left-wing ) . These are more dangerous than out-and-out reactionaries , for latter at least march under their true colors , whereas moderate left-wing leaders confuse people by employing devices of socialism to seine interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what deductions do they lead from standpoint of Soviet policy ? To following : <p> ( a ) Everything must be done to advance relative strength of USSR as factor in international society . Conversely , no opportunity most be missed to reduce strength and influence , collectively as well as individually , of capitalist powers . <p> ( b ) Soviet efforts , and those of Russia 's friends abroad , must be directed toward deepening and exploiting of differences and conflicts between capitalist powers . If these eventually deepen into an " imperialist " war , this war must be turned into revolutionary upheavals within the various capitalist countries . <p> ( c ) " Democratic-progressive " elements abroad are to be utilized to maximum to bring pressure to bear on capitalist governments along lines agreeable to Soviet interests . <p> ( d ) Relentless battle must be waged against socialist and social-democratic leaders abroad . <p> Part 2 : Background of Outlook <p> Before examining ramifications of this party line in practice there are certain aspects of it to which I wish to draw attention . <p> First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Latter are , by and large , friendly to outside world , eager for experience of it , eager to measure against it talents they are conscious of possessing , eager above all to live in peace and enjoy fruits of their own labor . Party line only represents thesis which official propaganda machine puts forward with great skill and persistence to a public often remarkably resistant in the stronghold of its innermost thoughts . But party line is binding for outlook and conduct of people who make up apparatus of power--party , secret police and Government--and it is exclusively with these that we have to deal . <p> Second , please note that premises on which this party line is based are for most part simply not true . Experience has shown that peaceful and mutually profitable coexistence of capitalist and socialist states is entirely possible . Basic internal conflicts in advanced countries are no longer primarily those arising out of capitalist ownership of means of production , but are ones arising from advanced urbanism and industrialism as such , which Russia has thus far been spared not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capitalism do not always generate wars ; and not all wars are attributable to this cause . To speak of possibility of intervention against USSR today , after elimination of Germany and Japan and after example of recent war , is sheerest nonsense . If not provoked by forces of intolerance and subversion " capitalist " world of today is quite capable of living at peace with itself and with Russia . Finally , no sane person has reason to doubt sincerity of moderate socialist leaders in Western countries . Nor is it fair to deny success of their efforts to improve conditions for working population whenever , as in Scandinavia , they have been given chance to show what they could do . <p> Falseness of those premises , every one of which predates recent war , was amply demonstrated by that conflict itself Anglo-American differences did not turn out to be major differences of Western World . Capitalist countries , other than those of Axis , showed no disposition to solve their differences by joining in crusade against USSR . Instead of imperialist war turning into civil wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side with capitalist powers for an avowed community of aim . <p> Nevertheless , all these theses , however baseless and disproven , are being boldly put forward again today . What does this indicate ? It indicates that Soviet party line is not based on any objective analysis of situation beyond Russia 's borders ; that it has , indeed , little to do with conditions outside of Russia ; that it arises mainly from basic inner-Russian necessities which existed before recent war and exist today . <p> At bottom of Kremlin 's neurotic view of world affairs is traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity . Originally , this was insecurity of a peaceful agricultural people trying to live on vast exposed plain in neighborhood of fierce nomadic peoples . To this was added , as Russia came into contact with economically advanced West , fear of more competent , more powerful , more highly organized societies in that area . But this latter type of insecurity was one which afflicted rather Russian rulers than Russian people ; for Russian rulers have invariably sensed that their rule was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation , unable to stand comparison or contact with political systems of Western countries . For this reason they have always feared foreign penetration , feared direct contact between Western world and their own , feared what would happen if Russians learned truth about world without or if foreigners learned truth about world within . And they have learned to seek security only in patient but deadly struggle for total destruction of rival power , never in compacts and compromises with it . <p> It was no coincidence that Marxism , which had smoldered ineffectively for half a century in Western Europe , caught hold and blazed for first time in Russia . Only in this land which had never known a friendly neighbor or indeed any tolerant equilibrium of separate powers , either internal or international , could a doctrine thrive which viewed economic conflicts of society as insoluble by peaceful means . After establishment of Bolshevist regime , Marxist dogma , rendered even more truculent and intolerant by Lenin 's interpretation , became a perfect vehicle for sense of insecurity with which Bolsheviks , even more than previous Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its basic altruism of purpose , they found justification for their instinctive fear of outside world , for the dictatorship without which they did not know how to rule , for cruelties they did not dare not to inflict , for sacrifice they felt bound to demand . In the name of Marxism they sacrificed every single ethical value in their methods and tactics . Today they can not dispense with it . It is fig leaf of their moral and intellectual respectability . Without it they would stand before history , at best , as only the last of that long succession of cruel and wasteful Russian rulers who have relentlessly forced country on to ever new heights of military power in order to guarantee external security of their internally weak regimes . This is why Soviet purposes most always be solemnly clothed in trappings of Marxism , and why no one should underrate importance of dogma in Soviet affairs . Thus Soviet leaders are driven by ? necessities of their own past and present position to put forward which apparent omission outside world as evil , hostile and menacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destined to be wracked with growing internal convulsions until it is given final Coup de grace by rising power of socialism and yields to new and better world . This thesis provides justification for that increase of military and police power of Russian state , for that isolation of Russian population from outside world , and for that fluid and constant pressure to extend limits of Russian police power which are together the natural and instinctive urges of Russian rulers . Basically this is only the steady advance of uneasy Russian nationalism , a centuries old movement in which conceptions of offense and defense are inextricably confused . But in new guise of international Marxism , with its honeyed promises to a desperate and war torn outside world , it is more dangerous and insidious than ever before . <p> It should not be thought from above that Soviet party line is necessarily disingenuous and insincere on part of all those who put it forward . Many of them are too ignorant of outside world and mentally too dependent to question apparent omission self-hypnotism , and who have no difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe . Finally we have the unsolved mystery as to who , if anyone , in this great land actually receives accurate and unbiased information about outside world . In atmosphere of oriental secretiveness and conspiracy which pervades this Government , possibilities for distorting or poisoning sources and currents of information are infinite . The very disrespect of Russians for objective truth--indeed , their disbelief in its existence--leads them to view all stated facts as instruments for furtherance of one ulterior purpose or another . There is good reason to suspect that this Government is actually a conspiracy within a conspiracy ; and I for one am reluctant to believe that Stalin himself receives anything like an objective picture of outside world . Here there is ample scope for the type of subtle intrigue at which Russians are past masters . Inability of foreign governments to place their case squarely before Russian policy makers--extent to which they are delivered up in their relations with Russia to good graces of obscure and unknown advisors whom they never see and can not influence--this to my mind is most disquieting feature of diplomacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to keep in mind if they would understand nature of difficulties encountered here . <p> We have now seen nature and background of Soviet program . What may we expect by way of its practical implementation ? <p> Soviet policy , as Department implies in its query under reference , is conducted on two planes : ( 1 ) official plane represented by actions undertaken officially in name of Soviet Government ; and ( 2 ) subterranean plane of actions undertaken by agencies for which Soviet Government does not admit responsibility . <p> Policy promulgated on both planes will be calculated to serve basic policies ( a ) to ( d ) outlined in part 1 . Actions taken on different planes will differ considerably , but will dovetail into each other in purpose , timing and effect . <p> On official plane we must look for following : <p> ( a ) Internal policy devoted to increasing in every way strength and prestige of Soviet state : intensive **26;6260;TOOLONG ; maximum development of armed forces ; great displays to impress outsiders ; continued secretiveness about internal matters , designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ( b ) Wherever it is considered timely and promising , efforts will be made to advance official limits of Soviet power . For the moment , these efforts are restricted to certain neighboring points conceived of here as being of immediate strategic necessity , such as Northern Iran , Turkey , possibly Bornholm However , other points may at any time come into question , if and as concealed Soviet political power is extended to new areas . Thus a " friendly Persian Government might be asked to grant Russia a port on Persian Gulf . Should Spain fall under Communist control , question of Soviet base at Gibraltar Strait might be activated . But such claims will appear on official level only when unofficial preparation is complete . <p> ( c ) Russians will participate officially in international organizations where they see opportunity of extending Soviet power or of inhibiting or diluting power of others . Moscow sees in UNO not the mechanism for a permanent and stable world society founded on mutual interest and aims of all nations , but an arena in which aims just mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered here to serve this purpose , Soviets will remain with it . But if at any time they come to conclusion that it is serving to embarrass or frustrate their aims for power expansion and if they see better prospects for pursuit of these aims along other lines , they will not hesitate to abandon UNO . This would imply , however , that they felt themselves strong enough to split unity of other nations by their withdrawal to render UNO ineffective as a threat to their aims or security , replace it with an international weapon more effective from their viewpoint . Thus Soviet attitude toward UNO will depend largely on loyalty of other nations to it , and on degree of vigor , decisiveness and cohesion with which those nations defend in UNO the peaceful and hopeful concept of international life , which that organization represents to our way of thinking . I reiterate , Moscow has no abstract devotion to UNO ideals . Its attitude to that organization will remain essentially pragmatic and tactical . <p> ( d ) Toward colonial areas and backward or dependent peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be directed toward weakening of power and influence and contacts of advanced Western nations , on theory that in so far as this policy is successful , there will be created a vacuum which will favor Communist-Soviet penetration . Soviet pressure for participation in trusteeship arrangements thus represents , in my opinion , a desire to be in a position to complicate and inhibit exertion of Western influence at such points rather than to provide major channel for exerting of Soviet power . Latter motive is not lacking , but for this Soviets prefer to rely on other channels than official trusteeship arrangements . Thus we may expect to find Soviets asking for admission everywhere to trusteeship or similar arrangements and using levers thus acquired to weaken Western influence among such peoples . <p> ( e ) Russians will strive energetically to develop Soviet representation in , and official ties with , countries in which they sense Strong possibilities of opposition to Western centers of power . This applies to such widely separated points as Germany , Argentina , Middle Eastern countries , etc . <p> ( f ) In international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit of autarchy for Soviet Union and Soviet-dominated adjacent areas taken together . That , however , will be underlying policy . As far as official line is concerned , position is not yet clear . Soviet Government has shown strange reticence since termination hostilities on subject foreign trade . If large scale long term credits should be forthcoming , I believe Soviet Government may eventually again do lip service , as it did in 1930 's to desirability of building up international economic exchanges in general . Otherwise I think it possible Soviet foreign trade may be restricted largely to Soviet 's own security sphere , including occupied areas in Germany , and that a cold official shoulder may be turned to principle of general economic collaboration among nations . <p> ( g ) With respect to cultural collaboration , lip service will likewise be rendered to desirability of deepening cultural contacts between peoples , but this will not in practice be interpreted in any way which could weaken security position of Soviet peoples . Actual manifestations of Soviet policy in this respect will be restricted to arid channels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vodka and speeches and dearth of permanent effects . <p> ( h ) Beyond this , Soviet official relations will take what might be called " correct " course with individual foreign governments , with great stress being laid on prestige of Soviet Union and its representatives and with punctilious attention to protocol as distinct from good manners . <p> Part 4 : Following May Be Said as to What We May Expect by Way of Implementation of Basic Soviet Policies on Unofficial , or Subterranean Plane , i.e. on Plane for Which Soviet Government Accepts no Responsibility <p> Agencies utilized for promulgation of policies on this plane are following : <p> 1 . Inner central core of Communist Parties in other countries . While many of persons who compose this category may also appear and act in unrelated public capacities , they are in reality working closely together as an underground operating directorate of world communism , a concealed Comintern tightly coordinated and directed by Moscow . It is important to remember that this inner core is actually working on underground lines , despite legality of parties with which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist Parties . Note distinction is drawn between those and persons defined in paragraph 1 . This distinction has become much sharper in recent years . Whereas formerly foreign Communist Parties represented a curious ( and from Moscow 's standpoint often inconvenient ) mixture of conspiracy and legitimate activity , now the conspiratorial element has been neatly concentrated in inner circle and ordered underground , while rank and file--no longer even taken into confidence about realities of movement--are thrust forward as bona fide internal partisans of certain political tendencies within their respective countries , genuinely innocent of conspiratorial connection with foreign states . Only in certain countries where communists are numerically strong do they now regularly appear and act as a body . As a rule they are used to penetrate , and to influence or dominate , as case may be , other organizations less likely to be suspected of being tools of Soviet Government , with a view to accomplishing their purposes through apparent omission organizations , rather than by direct action as a separate political party . <p> 3 . A wide variety of national associations or bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These include : labor unions , youth leagues , women 's organizations , racial societies , religious societies , social organizations , cultural groups , liberal magazines , publishing houses , etc . <p> 4 . International organizations which can be similarly penetrated through influence over various national components . Labor , youth and women 's organizations are prominent among them . Particular , almost vital importance is attached in this connection to international labor movement . In this , Moscow sees possibility of sidetracking western governments in world affairs and building up international lobby capable of compelling governments to take actions favorable to Soviet interests in various countries and of paralyzing actions disagreeable to USSR <p> 5 . Russian Orthodox Church , with its foreign branches , and through it the Eastern Orthodox Church in general . <p> 7 . Governments or governing groups willing to lend themselves to Soviet purposes in one degree or another , such as present Bulgarian and Yugoslav Governments , North Persian regime , Chinese Communists , etc . Not only propaganda machines but actual policies of these regimes can be placed extensively at disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this far-flung apparatus will be utilized in accordance with their individual suitability , as follows : <p> ( a ) To undermine general political and strategic potential of major western powers . Efforts will be made in such countries to disrupt national self confidence , to hamstring measures of national defense , to increase social and industrial unrest , to stimulate all forms of disunity . All persons with grievances , whether economic or racial , will be urged to spelt redress not in mediation and compromise , but in defiant violent struggle for destruction of other elements of society . Here poor will be set against rich , black against white , young against old , newcomers against established residents , etc . <p> ( b ) On unofficial plane particularly violent efforts will be made to weaken power and influence of Western Powers of on colonial backward , or dependent peoples . On this level , no holds will be barred . Mistakes and weaknesses of western colonial administration will be mercilessly exposed and exploited . Liberal opinion in Western countries will be mobilized to weaken colonial policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while latter are being encouraged to seek independence of Western Powers , Soviet dominated puppet political machines will be undergoing preparation to take over domestic power in respective colonial areas when independence is achieved . <p> ( c ) Where individual governments stand in path of Soviet purposes pressure will be brought for their removal from office . This can happen where governments directly oppose Soviet foreign policy aims ( Turkey , Iran ) , where they seal their territories off against Communist penetration ( Switzerland , Portugal ) , or where they compete too strongly , like Labor Government in England , for moral domination among elements which it is important for Communists to dominate . ( Sometimes , two of these elements are present in a single case . Then Communist opposition becomes particularly shrill and savage . ) <p> ( d ) In foreign countries Communists will , as a rule , work toward destruction of all forms of personal independence , economic , political or moral . Their system can handle only individuals who have been brought into complete dependence on higher power . Thus , persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , successful farmers , artisans and all those who exercise local leadership or have local prestige , such as popular local clergymen or political figures , are anathema . It is not by chance that even in USSR local officials are kept constantly on move from one job to another , to prevent their taking root . <p> ( e ) Everything possible will be done to set major Western Powers against each other . Anti-British talk will be plugged among Americans , anti-American talk among British . Continentals , including Germans , will be taught to abhor both Anglo-Saxon powers . Where suspicions exist , they will be fanned ; where not , ignited . No effort will be spared to discredit and combat all efforts which threaten to lead to any sort of unity or cohesion among other apparent omission from which Russia might be excluded . Thus , all forms of international organization not amenable to Communist penetration and control , whether it be the Catholic apparent omission international economic concerns , or the international fraternity of royalty and aristocracy , must expect to find themselves under fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f ) In general , all Soviet efforts on unofficial international plane will be negative and destructive in character , designed to tear down sources of strength beyond reach of Soviet control . This is only in line with basic Soviet instinct that there can be no compromise with rival power and that constructive work can start only when Communist power is doming But behind all this will be applied insistent , unceasing pressure for penetration and command of key positions in administration and especially in police apparatus of foreign countries . The Soviet regime is a police regime par excellence , reared in the dim half world of Tsarist police intrigue , accustomed to think primarily in terms of police power . This should never be lost sight of in ganging Soviet motives . <p> Part 5 : Practical Deductions From Standpoint of US Policy <p> In summary , we have here a political force committed fanatically to the belief that with US there can be no permanent modus vivendi that it is desirable and necessary that the internal harmony of our society be disrupted , our traditional way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be broken , if Soviet power is to be secure . This political force has complete power of disposition over energies of one of world 's greatest peoples and resources of world 's richest national territory , and is borne along by deep and powerful currents of Russian nationalism . In addition , it has an elaborate and far flung apparatus for exertion of its influence in other countries , an apparatus of amazing flexibility and versatility , managed by people whose experience and skill in underground methods are presumably without parallel in history . Finally , it is seemingly inaccessible to considerations of reality in its basic reactions . For it , the vast fund of objective fact about human society is not , as with us , the measure against which outlook is constantly being tested and re-formed , but a grab bag from which individual items are selected arbitrarily and tendenciously to bolster an outlook already preconceived . This is admittedly not a pleasant picture . Problem of how to cope with this force in is undoubtedly greatest task our diplomacy has ever faced and probably greatest it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of departure from which our political general staff work at present juncture should proceed . It should be approached with same thoroughness and care as solution of major strategic problem in war , and if necessary , with no smaller outlay in planning effort . I can not attempt to suggest all answers here . But I would like to record my conviction that problem is within our power to solve--and that without recourse to any general military conflict .. And in support of this conviction there are certain observations of a more encouraging nature I should like to make : <p> ( 1 ) Soviet power , unlike that of Hitlerite Germany , is neither schematic nor adventunstic . It does not work by fixed plans . It does not take unnecessary risks . Impervious to logic of reason , and it is highly sensitive to logic of force . For this reason it can easily withdraw--and usually does when strong resistance is encountered at any point . Thus , if the adversary has sufficient force and makes clear his readiness to use it , he rarely has to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no prestige-engaging showdowns . <p> ( 2 ) Gauged against Western World as a whole , Soviets are still by far the weaker force . Thus , their success will really depend on degree of cohesion , firmness and vigor which Western World can muster . And this is factor which it is within our power to influence . <p> ( 3 ) Success of Soviet system , as form of internal power , is not yet finally proven . It has yet to be demonstrated that it can survive supreme test of successive transfer of power from one individual or group to another . Lenin 's death was first such transfer , and its effects wracked Soviet state for 15 years . After Stalin 's death or retirement will be second . But even this will not be final test . Soviet internal system will now be subjected , by virtue of recent territorial expansions , to series of additional strains which once proved severe tax on Tsardom . We here are convinced that never since termination of civil war have mass of Russian people been emotionally farther removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , party has now become a great and--for the moment--highly successful apparatus of dictatorial administration , but it has ceased to be a source of emotional inspiration . Thus , internal soundness and permanence of movement need not yet be regarded as assured . <p> ( 4 ) All Soviet propaganda beyond Soviet security sphere is basically negative and destructive . It should therefore be relatively easy to combat it by any intelligent and really constructive program . <p> For those reasons I think we may approach calmly and with good heart problem of how to deal with Russia . As to how this approach should be made , I only wish to advance , by way of conclusion , following comments : <p> ( 1 ) Our first step must be to apprehend , and recognize for what it is , the nature of the movement with which we are dealing . We must study it with same courage , detachment , objectivity , and same determination not to be emotionally provoked or unseated by it , with which doctor studies unruly and unreasonable individual . <p> ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realities of Russian situation . I can not over-emphasize importance of this . Press can not do this alone . It must be done mainly by Government , which is necessarily more experienced and better informed on practical problems involved . In this we need not be deterred by ugliness ? of picture . I am convinced that there would be far less hysterical anti-Sovietism in our country today if realities of this situation were better understood by our people . There is nothing as dangerous or as terrifying as the unknown . It may also be argued that to reveal more information on our difficulties with Russia would reflect unfavorably on Russian-American relations . I feel that if there is any real risk here involved , it is one which we should have courage to face , and sooner the better . But I can not see what we would be risking . Our stake in this country , even coming on heels of tremendous demonstrations of our friendship for Russian people , is remarkably small . We have here no investments to guard , no actual trade to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserve . Our only stake lies in what we hope rather than what we have ; and I am convinced we have better chance of realizing those hopes if our public is enlightened and if our dealings with Russians are placed entirely on realistic and matter-of-fact basis . <p> ( 3 ) Much depends on health and vigor of our own society . World communism is like malignant parasite which feeds only on diseased tissue . This is point at which domestic and foreign policies meets Every courageous and incisive measure to solve internal problems of our own society , to improve self-confidence , discipline , morale and community spirit of our own people , is a diplomatic victory over Moscow worth a thousand diplomatic notes and joint communiqus . If we can not abandon fatalism and indifference in face of deficiencies of our own society , Moscow will profit--Moscow can not help profiting by them in its foreign policies . <p> ( 4 ) We must formulate and put forward for other nations a much more positive and constructive picture of sort of world we would like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough to urge people to develop political processes similar to our own . Many foreign peoples , in Europe at least , are tired and frightened by experiences of past , and are less interested in abstract freedom than in security . They are seeking guidance rather than responsibilities . We should be better able than Russians to give them this . And unless we do , Russians certainly will . <p> ( 5 ) Finally we must have courage and self-confidence to cling to our own methods and conceptions of human society . After Al , the greatest danger that can befall us in coping with this problem of Soviet communism , is that we shall allow ourselves 
##329250 <h> ' Poof ! I was in template land ' <p> Florida elementary students are using colorful writing on the state exam -- the same colorful phrases in essay after essay . The Florida Education Department warned 49 schools about " template writing " on the FCAT , reports the Orlando Sentinel . <p> The department has dubbed the problematic essays " poof ! papers " because last year one of the most common examples was fourth-graders writing " Poof ! " and then going to dragon land , pirate land , fairy land or candy land . " In the blink of an eye , " " one quintessential , supersonic day , " and " a kaleidoscope of colors encircled me " were other popular phrases . <p> Of course , it could be a coincidence . Fourth graders always like to discuss their quintessential days . <p> The source is almost certainly the teachers , who show some model essays which the students then clumsily adapt . <p> But that does n't bother me . What gets me is that they mandate a standardized writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ template writing " ! What do they think the students and teachers are ... stupid ? OF COURSE they 're going to take the path of least resistance . <p> I teach a writing-tested grade in Florida and we are ENCOURAGED to use template writing . You should see the amount of paper the state sends us every year demonstrating what qualifies as good writing . Going outside the box will certainly not get high marks , and -- according to the latest workshops -- grammar and sentence structure do n't count ! ? ! And sure enough , some of my kids who could n't write their way out of a paper bag passed with 4s or higher . <p> Lynn , I get your students when they matriculate at university . " What ? We 're being graded on grammar ? ! You meanie ! No one has ever graded us on that before ! " It is really hard to convince them that writing grammatically actually matters when they 've had 12 years of training to the opposite view . <p> If the state has developed a test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why fault teachers and kids for using it ? You want better answers ? Write better prompts and assess the answers in a way that does n't reward the stuff you do n't want to see . <p> If you think there was cheating and collaboration during the actual test , handle that like you would any cheating . <p> This is bound to happen with high-stakes testing . And you really ca n't call it cheating . From what Lynn says , the teachers and the students are doing exactly what the state thought it wanted them to do ! <p> I 'm a passable writer . People usually are able to comprehend what I want to convey with minimal pain , but I certainly have no gift for turns of phrase . <p> Nonetheless I was shocked -- flummoxed -- stunned -- floored -- when I got to college and met people who could n't write worth a damn . My writings may wander , they may fret , and they certainly lack style -- but I do know basic ( and I do mean basic ) grammar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wondered how many of them had gotten admission , but I suppose that a basic familiarity with literacy has n't been important for a long time . ( I started college in 1993 . Let me assure you , the preparation of students at a very respectable small liberal arts school was abysmal . ) <p> " This is bound to happen with high-stakes testing . And you really ca n't call it cheating . " <p> See -- I do n't get why anyone believes that poor teaching is the inevitable consequence of making things matter . The stakes , in most cases are not terribly high . Kids in lower grades are seldom penalized ( or rewarded for that matter ) based on their test scores ( despite a few states that have experimented with holding kids back wholesale ) . Teachers , schools and districts , despite a whole lot of hysteria about jobs being threatened and funding lost ( blatently untrue ) , are mostly require to demonstrate efforts at improvement for five to seven years before the state of reconstitution is reached . Even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffled about . <p> Heaven forbid that students should be expected to demonstrate that they are able to communicate some organized thoughts by stringing sentences together . I do n't suggest that teaching writing is easy . But to suggest that the logical response to measuring the outcome of that teaching is that teachers , curriculum directors , principals and others will resort to drilling kids in " poof " essays ( or even the five paragraph standard , if taught in isolation from any other writing ) really does n't expect much from the profession . <p> And cheating is cheating . High stakes or no . It 's cheating when it happens on a bar exam ( pretty high stakes ) , or licensing exams , or even the eye exam for a driver 's license . It 's never hard , I suppose , to talk one 's self into believing its something else , but that 's in the nature of temptation -- not a result of the stakes . <p> The tests would n't have to yield these results it they were assessed well , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized thoughts by stringing sentences together , but here , seemed to particularly reward the use of colorful or vivid language , the teachers have to figure out a way to show the kids colorful or vivid language , which might even with good teacher involved emphasizing examples ( " oh , look at the alliteration in " quintessential , supersonic " ) , and then the kids use those examples . In this case , it would n't surprise me if the classrooms even had posters up throughout the year with , vivid transition ideas and " Poof , I was in land " as one of them . And I 'm guessing because it was at more than one school , some staff development classes or shared teaching materials spread the idea around . <p> I do n't see this as cheating unless the kids are coached on it during the actual test , the posters are still up in the room during testing , etc . If your law professor tells you that bar exam graders like to see this type of introduction , is that cheating ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a references to particular philosophies or cases is worth X number of points and they present you with a list of philosophies and cases , is that cheating ? <p> I would n't say so . Might there be a better why to teach writing ? Absolutely , but if you give high stakes tests that measure a particular thing , you create an incentive to address that particular thing specifically . <p> It would be interesting to know how the " Poof , I was in land essays did score-wise compared to similar quality essays that did n't use the templates . My guess is that they scored higher , and that 's why I think this particular testing is to blame rather than the teachers . <p> Margo- Whether you care to believe it or not ; kids , teachers and parents take standardized testing very seriously . It does n't matter that the tests themselves are n't used for promotion to the next grade or determining teacher pay . For everyone involved , the stakes are high . We can tell students that they 're well-prepared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue in the face , but when we show them examples or models of what they might use on their tests , they will frequently fall back on those models in lieu of something they come up with on their own . Generally speaking , they higher the stakes , the lower the confidence people place in their own skills and knowledge and the more they will rely on the advice or examples of others , especially when the task calls for creativity . ( Remember trying to figure out how to dance in a high school gym ? ) <p> And it 's not cheating . Remember ; the teacher told them that " quintessential " was a really neat adjective . And the in-service teacher told the classroom teacher that " quintessential " is a really neat adjective . And 
##331352 <h> Welcome to the Center on Capitalism and Society <p> Today 's established economics -- the economics dominant in classrooms , banks and governments -- misconceives the modern economy . This disconnect has consequences for how we understand history , how we make policy , and how we view capitalism . Its explanations fail and mislead at important junctures in modern history . <p> At the end of the previous decade , an enormous bubble in housing prices finally broke , leading to massive defaults on mortgages and insolvency of banks in the U.S. and U.K. But , even if we tweak them to make room for " poorly designed incentives " or " securities fraud , " the established models of asset prices and investment decisions can explain neither the towering rise nor the shuddering fall in the price of houses . In those models there are no expectations that could spark a 60 per cent rise in housing prices . The explanation of the asset price bubble is lacking in microeconomic foundations . <p> In recent decades , the idea of rational expectations made most participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always right . Judgment is not needed . Expertise is no longer required . These notions are based on the premise that market participants possess complete knowledge of how the economy works and use that to form " rational expectations . " But this theory is inapplicable to a modern economy , since its innovating makes its future largely unknowable . <p> Since 2000 , the U.S. economy has shown signs of a decline in " dynamism " -- its capacity and urge to make indigenous innovations . Neglect of business by banks , neglect of the long term by companies , and a drying up of venture capital all point to such a decline . The established theory can not address that concern since it fails to incorporate indigenous creativity , exploration of the unknown and discovery . <p> By the 1980s , it became obvious that continental western Europe lacked the dynamism it had displayed in the 1800s . The continent 's postwar " miracle " was mostly catch-up , not dynamism . In contrast , the U.S. retained its dynamism , as innovation surged in the 1920s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established theory say that the rise of the welfare state reduced after-tax wages , cutting the supply of labor . But this story is defective . When take-home pay moved to a lower growth path , reducing the incentive to work , private wealth gradually sank to a lower path , increasing the incentive to work . <p> In the early 1800s , the U.S. economy of Alexander Hamilton enjoyed a phenomenal " take-off " -- without railroads or steam power to speak of . In Europe , one country after another sooner or later experienced the same . The established body of economic theory offers no explanation of why this explosion occurred then or at all . The theory makes no room for any creative internal forces that may have powered it . <p> Until economics is grounded on the basic character of modern economies -- the ignorance , the uncertainty , and the new ideas for speculation and innovation -- it limits and distorts our view . <p> In response , the Center on Capitalism and Society is endeavoring to build a modern economics of the workings of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote economic inclusion and how the imperfect knowledge on which they operate opens them to healthy booms yet also to unhealthy booms and ensuing slumps . ( See our Mission statement . ) On these questions , work at the Center has already produced insights over this decade . <p> In its early years , following America 's brilliant innovation and joyous boom of the late 1990s , the Center saw modern capitalism to be the exemplar of economic dynamism . The recent crisis may not alter that judgment yet it has cast light on ways in which the financial sector may have diminished the economy 's dynamism and exacerbated the economy 's speculative excesses . The Center has been studying a restructure of the financial sector that would make it less accommodative and less vulnerable to speculative swings and make it once again a key contributor to the dynamism and inclusion of the business sector . <h> HIGHLIGHTS <p> Edmund Phelps gave the 5th annual Phelps Medal for Innovation to an Argentine company , Rizobacter , during a ceremony at the Catedra Phelps conference at the University of Buenos Aires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th , Edmund Phelps received at the annual Dinner and Award Ceremony of the Louise Blouin Foundation its Creative Leadership Award .

##335151 <h> Why do we need Leap Years ? <p> Leap Years are needed to keep our calendar in alignment with the Earth 's revolutions around the sun . It takes the Earth approximately 365.242199 days -- or 365 days , 5 hours , 48 minutes , and 46 seconds ( a tropical year ) -- to circle once around the Sun . <p> However , the Gregorian calendar has only 365 days in a year , so if we did n't add a day on February 29 nearly every 4 years , we would lose almost six hours off our calendar every year . After only 100 years , our calendar would be off by approximately 24 days ! <h> Which Years are Leap Years ? <p> In the Gregorian calendar 3 criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years : <p> The year is evenly divisible by 4 ; <p> If the year can be evenly divided by 100 , it is NOT a leap year , unless ; <p> The year 2000 was somewhat special as it was the first instance when the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transition from the Julian to the Gregorian Calendar . <h> Who invented Leap Years ? <p> Julius Caesar introduced Leap Years in the Roman empire over 2000 years ago , but the Julian calendar had only one rule : any year evenly divisible by 4 would be a leap year .

##339852 <h> A Short Historical Sketch on the Idea of Freedom ( An Introduction by James P. Young ) <p> Thomas Jefferson , principal author of the Declaration of Independence and third President of the United States <p> Locke 's influence on the thinking of Thomas Jefferson is obvious . Jefferson considered him , along with Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton , to be one of the three greatest men who ever lived . The theory of revolution expressed in the Declaration of Independence clearly reflects a Lockean inspiration , as do the document 's " self-evident " truths that " all men are created equal , " that they are born with " inalienable , " and that these rights include " life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . " Jefferson , who was a slaveholder , daily violated these rights , but as the modern scholar Judith Shklar correctly pointed out , he will long be remembered as the man who put them into play in world politics . It is also fair to note that Jefferson was plagued by guilt to the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated his principles . He knew that the problem of slavery had to be solved eventually , and indeed it was solved , at enormous cost , as discussed below . <p> Armed with Locke 's ideas about natural rights and the notion that governments derive their power from the consent of the governed , Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence provided a list of the king 's alleged violations of the colonist 's rights , followed by the conclusion that the colonies were justified in severing their links to the crown and establishing an independent nation . Still , as Shklar remarked , Locke 's ideas are considerably Americanized in the Declaration . The founders had little faith that simple majority rule would provide sufficient protection for individual rights , and the substitution of the phrase " pursuit of happiness " for Locke 's " estate " is striking and worthy of discussion . Notice , in particular , that we are guaranteed not happiness , but the right to pursue it ; such a pursuit may ultimately lead to considerable unhappiness . <p> The tradition of Lockean liberalism has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Alexis de Tocqueville 's remark in Democracy in America ( 1835 ) that Americans had been born equal rather than having to become so , the modern scholar Louis Hartz argued in The Liberal Tradition in America that all of American history has been enveloped in a liberal , essentially Lockean consensus , a consensus so deep that it was unconscious . <p> Alexis de Tocqueville , French political thinker and author of Democracy in America <p> Because of this , Hartz claimed , it is sometimes difficult for Americans to understand other political cultures that do not share these ideas . Of course a shrewd observer like Tocqueville knew better than to claim that all Americans were in fact equal . His statement was intended to draw a comparison with France , which he saw as more encumbered by class structures -- and thus more violent in forging an egalitarian , postrevolutionary society -- than the United States . Hartz similarly noted that the United States , unlike France , had essentially skipped feudalism and arrived at independence as a modern , rights-oriented , middle-class society . This theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great conflicts over slavery , industrialization , labor relations , and ethnicity . Nevertheless , it is true that the United States has historically been highly individualistic , rights-oriented in principle if not in practice , substantially middle class , and overwhelmingly capitalist in its economic tendencies . Hartz , despite the serious limitations of his analysis , offers great insights into this political culture . <p> The Constitution is basically a liberal document , in that it is predicated on the perception of government as a potential threat to individual rights and freedoms . Consider the Federalist Papers , often cited as an authority in attempts to interpret the intent of the framers of the Constitution . The papers , written by Alexander Hamilton , John Jay , and James Madison as part of the campaign to ratify the Constitution , describe the document as deliberately designed to make governmental decision making difficult so as to reduce the possibility of abuse of power and thereby maximize freedom . The key papers are Numbers 10 and 51 by Madison and Number 78 by Hamilton . ( Whether the papers truly represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular favored a much stronger central government and settled for the final document as the best that could be attained under the circumstances . ) <p> The Constitution is basically a liberal document . <p> Madison 's contributions emphasized the fragmentation of political and governmental power . Older theories of republican government held that republics could succeed only if they were quite small , since larger historical republics had been plagued by factional divisions . Faction was defined essentially as the subordination of public to private interests , or the permanent domination of the state by a single group . But Madison turned this theory on its head , arguing in Federalist 10 that the solution to the problem of faction was to increase the size of the political system . This in turn would increase the likelihood of a large number of factions whose competition would lead to a genuine balance of interests . Federalist 51 offers a similar argument with respect to the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches . <p> Founding Father Alexander Hamilton , first United States Secretary of the Treasury <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes , predicting that the president , the Senate , and the House of Representatives would jockey for power and check one another . In Federalist 78 , Hamilton adds to these two levels of complexity a theory of judicial review , giving the Supreme Court the power to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional . As noted above , Chief Justice John Marshall solidified this power in Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) . Finally , the country 's constitutional fragmentation of power at the national level is enhanced by the significant authority reserved by the states . <p> Every limited democratic government faces a fundamental problem in that it must follow the Lockean principle of majority rule while still protecting the inviolable rights of the minority . The difficult question of when minority rights are important enough to trump the will of the majority is central to debates on the meaning and requirements of freedom . <p> These freedoms are of two types : positive and negative . <p> To protect against the tyranny of the majority and further constrain the powers of government , the Constitution includes a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to various freedoms . Bills of attainder ( legislative declarations of guilt ) and ex post facto laws are forbidden . Jury trials are required , treason is carefully defined , and religious tests for public office are prohibited . In 1787 , these were fairly advanced ideas , though even some who supported ratification of the Constitution , including Jefferson , were dissatisfied by the absence of a formal , systematic statement of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms . A Bill of Rights , of which James Madison was the principal author , was soon attached to the newly ratified Constitution in the form of 10 amendments . Among other things , they guarantee freedom of the press , religion , and assembly ; due process of law and fair trials ; and protection against compulsory self-incrimination , unreasonable searches and seizures , double jeopardy , and cruel and unusual punishment . <p> James Madison , principal author of the Constitution of the United States of America and fourth President of the United States <p> These freedoms are of two types : positive and negative . Those like freedom of speech and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they represent " freedom to " do certain things . Many of the others are negative , since they promise " freedom from " certain actions by the government . The positive freedoms , which essentially describe democratic political activity and the exercise of civic freedom , depend on the negative freedoms , without which such activity would be impossible . Democracy in turn is necessary if personal liberty is to be preserved . <p> Following these improvements , the Constitution retained a glaring flaw in its tacit acceptance of slavery , the most fundamental denial of freedom imaginable and the issue that came to dominate 19th-century politics . <p> However , before turning to this problem , a few comments on the political structure of the Constitution are necessary . Though it was a liberal document , designed to protect individual rights and circumscribe the actions of government , it was , at best , imperfectly democratic . Suffrage was limited to free male citizens , and there were also property qualifications for the vote in many states . In fairness to the framers , the right to vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else at the time , and the system proved capable of accommodating subsequent expansions of suffrage , though often not without great struggle . Equally troublesome was the electoral college system created by the Constitution , which makes it possible for the loser of the popular vote to win the presidency . And until the ratification of the 17th Amendment in 1913 , senators were elected by state legislatures rather than popular vote ; even after the change , the fact that each state elects two senators gives lightly populated states a disproportionate influence . Moreover , as the political theorist George Kateb has pointed out , there are fewer limitations on the power of the Supreme Court than on the elected branches of the government . <p> Such apparently antidemocratic structures were in keeping with the founders " wariness of direct participation in politics by the citizenry as a whole . In Federalist 10 , Madison was explicitly skeptical of the sort of civic freedom exemplified by ancient Athens , and in Federalist 55 he bluntly concludes that " had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates , every Athenian assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to imagine an American polity as a direct democracy rather than a republic with representative institutions , but the low rate of popular participation in American politics today remains a concern . Finding the correct balance between democracy and constitutional limitations is critically important , but difficult to achieve . <p> By the 1830s , some of the obstacles to democracy described above were eroded by the elimination of property qualifications for suffrage . <p> Tocqueville believed that American democracy was the wave of the future . <p> The period was marked by a high degree of democratization , as discussed by Tocqueville in his classic Democracy in America , widely cited as one of the greatest books ever written on the United States . It is also considered an important contribution to democratic theory and one of the foundational works of political sociology . As hinted earlier , democracy and egalitarianism were essentially synonymous for Tocqueville . He believed that American democracy was the wave of the future . His teacher , the French historian Francois Guizot , said to him , " You judge ' democracy ' like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his conqueror is right . " Indeed Tocqueville was probably less worried by democratic forces than was Madison . As long as there was no strong , centralized state and Americans continued to show a propensity to create many active local political groups , he concluded , democracy was secure . Political participation , specifically in local voluntary associations , provided " great free schools " for citizenship . Local associations and the influence of religion fostered the pursuit of " self-interest rightly understood , " by which Tocqueville means a balance between the public and private interest . This did not lead to a " sublime " public philosophy , but rather one that produced orderly , self-controlled citizens who were ready to cooperate with their fellows to further the general welfare . <p> Still , Tocqueville feared the development of American materialism and the emergence of a " manufacturing aristocracy . " The greatest danger he saw in America was the potential conversion of the active citizens he observed into an apathetic mass , a condition that might arise out of egoistic individualism . Under these conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of public opinion , was a real problem . Beyond this , Tocqueville was deeply concerned with the possibility that the unsolved problem of slavery could lead to large-scale violence , as it later did . <p> Tocqueville 's ideas had a considerable

##349951 <h> Sign Up for Brew Your Own 's Free E-Newsletter <h> Birth of a New Style : Cascadian Dark Ale <p> Variety is the spice of life . For hundreds of years , wine drinkers have enjoyed many different wine varieties and a vast array of vintages . Beer aficionados , especially those in the US , have not been so lucky . It has only been since the late 70s and early 80s that a wider variety of beer styles have become readily available . We are now blessed with 78 beer styles , many with sub-categories , recognized by the Great American Beer Festival ( GABF ) . Most of these have been around for many years , with fewer styles being recent additions . That is what makes the birth of a new beer style exciting . <p> This brings us to the great Pacific Northwest , home to vast fields of barley and , of course , the two largest hop producing regions in North America -- the Yakima Valley and the Willamette Valley . With the most breweries of any city in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to Portland , Oregon as " Beervana . " What better place for the beginnings of a flavorful new beer style ? <p> On January 23rd , I was fortunate to be invited to a beer symposium to discuss Cascadian dark ale . Seven other beer writers and thirteen brewers gathered at one of the most famous bottle shops in the northwest , Belmont Station , to discuss this new style . The meeting was lead by Abram Goldman-Armstrong , a local beer writer and volunteer point man for promoting this new beer style . Nineteen examples of the proposed new style were present for a tasting and to serve as a basis for evaluating the limits of the style parameters . Industry leaders like Rob Widmer of Widmer Brewing were among the attendees to offer their support and feedback . The plan was to finalize the style descriptors and basic recipe guidelines . Once completed , this information would be forwarded to the Brewers Association ( BA ) , organizers of the GABF , and also to the Beer Judge Certification Program ( BJCP ) for their consideration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The term " Cascadia " is derived from the Cascade Mountain Range . It is used to describe a self -designated region that encompasses British Columbia , Washington , Oregon , western Idaho and northern California . This area , also known as " The Peoples Republic of Cascadia , " has been the source of many stories and rumors . There has been talk of seceding from the union in order to protect the hop supply . A Cascadian flag has even been created featuring a tall evergreen tree and three colors , blue , white and green representing blue sky , white capped mountains and green forests . <p> Who brewed the first version of this style is a point of great debate . Some say Greg Noonan of Vermont brewed one in the early 90s , but this ca n't be substantiated . What we do know is that the first two widely-known examples came from the Northwest . In 2003 , John Maier of Rogue Brewing in Newport , Oregon made Skull Splitter , a black interpretation of his Brutal Bitter strong IPA . About that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , British Columbia brewed Black Toque which he labeled an India Dark Ale . ( Dogfish Head 's Indian Brown Ale , a beer with a similar mix of dark grains and extensive hops , has been available since 1999 . ) <p> Since then , many dark brown to black beers of IPA proportions have been brewed by Northwest breweries , usually as a specialty beer for a festival . The style gained greater exposure when Widmer Brewing 's W-10 , also know as Pitch Black IPA , won a gold medal in last year 's Great American Beer Festival ( GABF ) . Now this beer is part of their bottled line up and distributed in several states . Probably the biggest indicator of the popularity of this style was that nineteen breweries produced the examples we tasted for this symposium . So , what is so special about this beer ? <p> A quick review of the specifications we proposed will provide your first clue : <p> Flavor -- A balance between citrus like and spicy Northwest hop flavor , bitterness , caramel and roast , chocolate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdued . Black malt is acceptable at low levels but should not be astringent . Any burnt character is not appropriate . The finish should be dry with caramel malt as a secondary flavor . Diacetyl should not be present . The main emphasis should be on hop flavor . <p> Mouthfeel -- Light to medium , hop bitterness and tannins from roast malts combine to create a dry mouthfeel . Resinous character from high levels of dry hopping may create a tongue coating sensation . <p> Comments -- Some brewers prefer to cold steep the dark grains to achieve a very dark beer without the tannin contribution of adding these grains to the mash . The use of Sinamarr color extract to enhance the color is common . <p> What differentiates Cascadian dark ale from a hoppy porter or stout ? There are really three main differences . The first would be the basic hop profile . These beers are brewed using traditional IPA bittering , flavor and aroma hops with citrus , spice and floral characteristics . Typical hop selections would be Columbus , Centennial , Chinook , Amarillo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Magnum . The second would be the vastly reduced roast malt flavor contributions . The use of debittered Carafar malts instead of black patent or roast barley . This provides color without the harsher , burnt flavor profiles of robust porters or stouts . And finally , the third is the much drier finish . This is achieved through the use of very little light caramel malts and highly attenuative yeasts . <p> It should be easy to see that this is a big , dark , hoppy beer of proportions that certainly puts it in a classification of its own . The 19 examples we evaluated had interesting names such as Dark Days Black , Arctic Apocalypse , Black Sheep , Hop In The Dark , and Chaos Imperial Dark . After tasting each one , our panel discussed the flavor profile to see how they compared . It was agreed that one of the key characteristics of this style was that the dark malts are so subdued that , if you closed your eyes during a sip , you would not suspect that the beer was black . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malts and citrusy Northwest IPA hops like Cascade , Simcoe and Amarillo exposed unsuspected flavors . Some picked up a minty flavor while others used descriptors of herbal and rosemary-like . The professional brewers all agreed that a neutral yeast of the American ale variety was advisable to use . <p> By the end of the tasting , the guidelines were finalized and Abram forwarded these to the BA ? and BJCP . In a letter dated February 11th sent from Chris Swersey , competition manager of the GABF , the good news was received . Charlie Papazian had completed the style update for 2010 and included this new style . The name " Cascadian " was deleted as it was felt that non-Northwestern brewers may be turned off to the style if it hinted of regional exclusivity . The accepted name is American-Style India Black Ale . The style descriptors remained relatively unchanged but some of the basic specifications were scaled back . Here are the finalized GABF numbers : <p> The BJCP does not update their style guidelines yearly , as the GABF does , and Cascadian dark ale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unofficial feedback from BJCP ? officials indicates that , if examples of this beer start showing up at homebrew contests at a reasonable frequency , it could be included in the next style guideline revisions . ( If you choose to compete with this style , enter it in Category 23 and describe the beer as a Cascadian dark ale , an India Black Ale or Black IPA . ) <p> Now that you understand the origins of the style , take a look at the recipes to see how to brew one .

##351451 <p> More and more , my girl-friends and I interact like normal grown-ups : I eat with some of them once or twice a week , others I just have tea with every other month . These catch-ups have no clear purpose , we just exchange random gossip or tips on where to shop for what . And when once a child asked me : Are n't you guys best friends ? How come you 're so not close to each other ? And why do you never seem to talk about your feelings ? -- -- I had no explanation for it , I could only shrug and say : There 's nothing unhappy happening , you know , and only suffering has this deep aspect . Happy life is just shallow . <p> Then I thought of what another friend told me . After returning from living overseas , he saidindifference was the thing he found most unbearable in the West , a kind of loneliness which does n't get away with people around you . He never knew whom he could share his feelings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , apart from saying " fine " or " not bad " , what else could you say ? No one really cares if you 're doing well or not , the question is like our " have you eaten yet ? " , it 's merely politeness . If you say straightaway " I have n't been well lately " , or " I 'm feeling a bit upset " , you wo n't get anything but a look of surprise and a " sorry " . The fact is , in their view , discussing your private affairs in public is embarrassing . Since we 're all adults , every situation we find ourselves in is the result of own own choices , and if you ca n't bear the consequence of your own choices , other people will be even more helpless than you . <p> This may be a cold , rational attitude . But I think we do n't show enough that attitude , even as we say that relations between people are not warm enough . In the end , I think we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having " warm feelings " . I always remember this quote : " every adult has a wound in their heart " . Every single person has gone through pain and frustration growing up , so why think that our friends should also be our carers . This is in fact a form of emotional blackmail . For instance , when you complain to your girlfriend that your boyfriend is not considerate enough , perhaps she 's thinking to herself " how can I deal with my mother-in-law and her onsets of menopause , " and in front of this issu e , you 've already become a cloud . When we 're catching up , is it that difficult to simply exchange a few news and spend a nice , relaxing time together ? <p> You may see this as a kind of wasteland , a cold feeling from the heart , the " urban disease " that all complain about : how everyone looks glamorous , but behind that facade , everyone is just tired and cold . But letting this coldness and negativity come out , will that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thinking that you 're always ready to extend a helping hands to your friends , and therefore others should do the same towards you and listen to your endless complaints , demanding that your friends comfort you : that is an irresponsible attitude towards yourself . <p> Anyway , going along the road of life , we must eventually do our own walking , and having a partner who shares our values is not such an occasion to rejoice , because as we walk , we 'll also complain to each other about how our feet hurt and our pack is heavy .

Our individual equity approach focuses on high quality companies that frequently pay distributions of income via dividends and continue to exhibit growth of such income . Diligent research , diversification and a global perspective provide the framework for the investments we make . <p> We believe in comprehensive research . We digest information related to the macro environment from the top down but dissect companies and fund managers from the bottom up . Individual stocks , much like individual managers , must exhibit management strength , market dominance , consistent growth and financial stability to warrant investment . A patient , long-term approach grants investors the ability to take advantage of undervalued investments when market dislocations occur . <p> Our sell strategy could be triggered by multiple factors . These may include : a position becomes concentrated within the portfolio , a position is observed to be over-valued from a historical perspective or a sector perspective , 
##355951 <p> Hear , O Israel ! - This was said to call the attention of the Jews to the great importance of the truth about to be proclaimed . See Deuteronomy 6:4-5 . <p> The Lord our God ... - Literally , " Yahweh , our God , is one Yahweh . " The other nations worshipped many gods , but the God of the Jews was one , and one only . ? ? ? ? Yahweh was undivided ; and this great truth it was the design of the separation of the Jewish people from other nations to keep in mind . This was the " peculiar " truth which was communicated to the Jews , and this they were required to keep and remember forever . <p> Jesus answered him , the first of all the commandments is , .... Christ replied at once , without taking any time to consider of it , that the chief and principal of all the commands of the law , and what is of the greatest importance is , <p> hear , O Israel , the Lord our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabic versions read , " one God " ; but the Syriac , and Ethiopic render it , " one Lord " ; and that rightly , agreeably to the Greek text , and to Deuteronomy 6:4 , from whence this is taken . This passage of Scripture , to the end of the ninth verse , is the first of the sections which were put into their phylacteries ; See Gill on Matthew 23:5 ; and was repeated twice every day , morning and evening ; which is by the Jews called from the first word , " the reading of the Shema " : concerning the exact time of the reciting of this , morning and evening , and of the posture in which they do it , reclining in the evening , and standing in the morning , and of the prayers before and after it , various rules are given in their Misna ( p ) , or oral law ; it is a precept of great esteem and veneration with them , and attended to with much solemnity . The account Maimonides ( q ) gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they read Keriath Shema ; ( i.e. " hear , O Israel " , &c.); in the evening and in morning , as it is said , Deuteronomy 6:7 . " When thou liest down , and when thou risest up " ; in the hour it is the custom of men to lie down , and this is night ; and in the hour it is the custom of men to stand , and this is day : and what does he read ? three sections ; and they are these , " hear " , &c.; Deuteronomy 6:4 , and it shall come to pass , " if ye shall hearken " , &c.; Deuteronomy 11:13 , " and Moses said " , &c.; Exodus 13:3 , and they read the section , " hear , O Israel " , first , because there is in it the unity of God , and the love of him and his doctrine ; for it is , , " the great root " , or " foundation " , on which all hangs or depends . ' ' <p> And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hear " , and the last of the word " one " , are both written in very large characters in the Hebrew Bible , to denote the greatness of the command , and to cause attention to it . The Jews seek for mysteries in these letters , and think the unusual size of them , points at some very great things : they observe , that the first of these letters is numerically " seventy " , and directs to the seventy names of the law , and the seventy ways in which it may be interpreted , and the seventy nations of the world , from whom the Israelites are distinguished , by their belief of the one God ( r ) ; and that the latter stands for the number " four " , and shows that the Lord is the one God , in heaven and in earth , in all the world , and in the four parts of it ; and that both these letters put together , make a word , which signifies " a witness " ; showing that this passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the Israelites are witnesses of it , by believing and professing it ; and that should they depart from the faith of it , God would be a witness against them : and now , though there is no solid foundation for such interpretations , yet this shows what an opinion they had of the greatness of this command ; to which , may be added , they ask ( s ) , <p> " why does , " hear , O Israel " , &c.; go before that passage in Deuteronomy 11:13 . " And it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments " , &c.; but because a man must take upon him , first the yoke of the kingdom of heaven , and after that he must take upon him the yoke of the commandments . ' ' <p> The sense is , that he must first make a confession of his faith in God , which is contained in Deuteronomy 6:4 and then he must obey his commands ; so that they plainly considered this , as the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouths of the modern Jews , in proof of the unity of God , and against a plurality in the Deity ; but the ancient ones , not only consider them as a good and sufficient proof , that there is but one God , but as expressive of a Trinity in the Godhead : with a view to this text they observe ( t ) , that <p> " there is an unity which is called Jehovah the first , our God , Jehovah ; behold ! they are all one , and therefore called one : lo ! these three names are as one ; and although we call them one , and they are one ; but by the revelation of the Holy Ghost it is made known , and they are by the sight of the eye to be known , that " these three are one " , ( see 1 John 5:7 , ) and this is the mystery of the voice that is heard ; the voice is one ; and there are three things , fire , and wind , and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the voice , and they are not but one : so here , Jehovah , our God , Jehovah , these , , " three modes , forms " , or " things " , are one .

' ' <p> To which I shall subjoin one passage more , where R. Eliezer is asking his father R. Simeon ben Jochai , why Jehovah is sometimes called Elohim , he replies ( x ) , among other things ; <p> " come see , there are " three degrees " , ( or persons , ) and every degree is by itself ; although they are all one , and bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . ' ' <p> To believe this , is the first and chief commandment in the law , and is the principal article of the Christian faith ; namely , to believe that there is one God , and that there are three persons , Father , Son , and Spirit , in the Godhead . <p> 12:29 The Lord our God is one Lord - This is the foundation of the first commandment , yea , of all the commandments . The Lord our God , the Lord , the God of all men , is one God , essentially , though three persons . From this unity of God it follows , that we owe all our love to him alone . Deut 6:4 . <p> 29 . And Jesus answered him , The first of all the commandments is-The readings here vary considerably . Tischendorf and Tregelles read simply , " the first is " ; and they are followed by Meyer and Alford . But though the authority for the precise form of the received text is slender , a form almost identical with it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives His explicit sanction to the distinction between commandments of a more fundamental and primary character , and commandments of a more dependent and subordinate nature ; a distinction of which it is confidently asserted by a certain class of critics that the Jews knew nothing , that our Lord and His apostles nowhere lay down , and which has been invented by Christian divines . ( Compare Mt 23:23 ) . <p> Hear , O Israel ; the Lord our God is one Lord-This every devout Jew recited twice every day , and the Jews do it to this day ; thus keeping up the great ancient national protest against the polytheisms and pantheisms of the heathen world : it is the great utterance of the national faith in One Living and Personal God- " One Jehovah ! " <p> 12:28-34 Those who sincerely desire to be taught their duty , Christ will guide in judgment , and teach his way . He tells the scribe that the great commandment , which indeed includes all , is , that of loving God with all our hearts . Wherever this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition to every other duty . Loving God with all our heart , will engage us to every thing by which he will be pleased . The sacrifices only represented the atonements for men 's transgressions of the moral law ; they were of no power except as they expressed repentance and faith in the promised Saviour , and as they led to moral obedience . And because we have not thus loved God and man , but the very reverse , therefore we are condemned sinners ; we need repentance , and we need mercy . Christ approved what the scribe said , and encouraged him . He stood fair for further advance ; for this knowledge of the law leads to conviction of sin , to repentance , to discovery of our need of mercy , and understanding the way of justification by Christ . <p> Deuteronomy 6:4 Hear , O Israel : The LORD our God , the LORD is one . Psalm 86:10 For you are great and do marvelous deeds ; you alone are God . James 2:19 You believe that there is one God 
##356252 <p> Network Working Group S. Bradner Request for Comments : 2119 Harvard University BCP : 14 March 1997 Category : Best Current Practice Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels Status of this Memo This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community , and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements . Distribution of this memo is unlimited . Abstract In many standards track documents several words are used to signify the requirements in the specification . These words are often capitalized . This document defines these words as they should be interpreted in IETF documents . Authors who follow these guidelines should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document : The key words " MUST " , " MUST NOT " , " REQUIRED " , " SHALL " , " SHALL NOT " , " SHOULD " , " SHOULD NOT " , " RECOMMENDED " , " MAY " , and " OPTIONAL " in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 . Note that the force of these words is modified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . 1 . MUST This word , or the terms " REQUIRED " or " SHALL " , mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification . 2 . MUST NOT This phrase , or the phrase " SHALL NOT " , mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification . 3 . SHOULD This word , or the adjective " RECOMMENDED " , mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item , but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course . 4 . SHOULD NOT This phrase , or the phrase " NOT RECOMMENDED " mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful , but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label . Bradner Best Current Practice Page 1 RFC 2119 RFC Key Words March 1997 5 . MAY This word , or the adjective " OPTIONAL " , mean that an item is truly optional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item . An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option , though perhaps with reduced functionality . In the same vein an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option ( except , of course , for the feature the option provides. ) 6 . Guidance in the use of these Imperatives Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used with care and sparingly . In particular , they MUST only be used where it is actually required for interoperation or to limit behavior which has potential for causing harm ( e.g. , limiting retransmisssions ) For example , they must not be used to try to impose a particular method on implementors where the method is not required for interoperability. 7 . Security Considerations These terms are frequently used to specify behavior with security implications . The effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or doing something the specification says MUST NOT or SHOULD NOT be done may be very subtle . Document authors should take the time to elaborate the security implications of not following recommendations or requirements as most implementors will not have had the benefit of the experience and discussion that produced the specification . 8 . Acknowledgments The definitions of these terms are an amalgam of definitions taken from a number of RFCs . In addition , suggestions have been incorporated from a number of people including Robert Ullmann , Thomas Narten , Neal McBurnett , and Robert Elz .

##358651 <p> Mitt Romney 's latest unforced error has a lot of Republicans worried that his , and by extension , their , chances of winning this election are slipping away . <p> As Politico puts it , " If political campaigns have nine lives , nervous Republicans feel Romney has used up at least eight .

" <p> The leaked video could damage Romney 's support among some Republican voters like seniors or members of the military , not to mention Independents . <p> Which is why some Republicans , including Massachusetts Sen.

Romney does nt even make an attempt to solve our trade policy treasons with any semblance of competing.He could win state of washington , but , thinks its already over here cuz democrats try to buy votes with welfare . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 2:28 pm <p> Ann from Charleston SC <p> Romney needs to figure out who those of us making up the 99% are -- what we believe , what we want , how we see ourselves as Americans , where we stand on various issues , where we want this country to go . He does n't seem to understand that the economy is only one part of who we are as a people , and he does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Become somebody else . He ca n't change who he is . On that " 47% Video " , he sounded authentic .

Thesse things are treasonous trade deals but the 2 party monopoly does nt think he should complain <p> September 19 , 2012 at 2:31 pm <p> Cindy Cavanaugh <p> He ca n't ! He basically said If you are a student , stay at home mom , senior with little income , the working poor , many working middle class with college and mortgage deductions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some millionaires fall into this category , you are of NO Value to Romney and you EXPECT the government to take care of you , according to him . This is because he judges your worth by the amount of income tax you pay .... it does n't matter if you pay social security taxes , medicare taxes , property taxes , local taxes , state taxes , sales taxes etc ... It does n't even matter if you 've ever taken one dime of government money or not . Who would want a president like this ? <p> September 19 , 2012 at 2:32 pm <p> Tish <p> Get a new ship ... one without any leaky holes in it , lol ! ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 2:36 pm <p> Dave Hancock <p> Try keeping his lips together and let someone else do the talking instead . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 2:39 pm <p> Leta <p> Mitt doesn , t have to do anything -- he is toast already .

He and Ryan are cruel , no compassion in the Americans struggling in this recession . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 2:42 pm <p> Gina <p> For a start he needs to produce his tax returns . If they show that he is part of the 47% of Americans he has no time for because they are lazy Americans who live off the government then it 's a sinking ship Jack ! My gutt tells me this is why we have not seen them . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 2:45 pm <p> Ron WPAFB <p> I 'm sorry , we do not have time for an exorcism and re-education ! This man is so out of touch , he adds a new definition to out of touch ! He does n't realize that there are millions of low paying jobs out there , and they need to be done ! When you 're only able to find low paying jobs , then benefits like Tax Deductions for Child Care and Home Mortgage help to sustain life ! If you still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a child , the tax credit helps you to care for the child . Children are important , the Religious Right should know that when Jesus was all about the children ! ! ! ! These people are not Victims , they are for the most part , hard working Americans trying to make a living while sustaining our economy , they are not going to disappear ! ! ! ! Yet , Romney thinks tax Credits and breaks for Major Corporations and Wealthy Americans is going to trickle down and fix the economy . He does not understand what middle income is , what poor is , but he will get a good look at them because they are the majority and will vote for Obama ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 2:49 pm <p> Kim , Dodge City , Kansas <p> The impossible ...... stop being Mitt Romney . He simply does not possess the abilty , the empathy , or the compassion to connect with the majority of citizens .

You know , moochers like senior citizens on Social Security , and US soldiers , who all get checks signed by Uncle Sam . <p> If he only cares about 1% of the population , then I hope he only gets 1% of the votes . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 2:54 pm <p> Bob in San Diego <p> Nothing . The below deck pumps are working to evacuate the effluent .

The water is still flowing and much more water will pass under the bridge before voting day . Mitt 's ship ai n't nowhere near sinking . Plenty of more water will flow around President Obama 's boat as well . Mitt needs to stay the course and keep pounding away about President Obama 's Oval Office record . <p> September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not think there is anything he can do at this point ! As a middle class person he has NO IDEA what it takes to live pay check to pay check . And by the way he can quit complaining about pople not paying income tax when he is hiding his , we have no idea what or if he has paid any . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 3:06 pm <p> Joe Erickson <p> Mr. Romney needs to apologize to the many Americans he said he does not care about . These Americans include : <p> The 592,000 American children receiving SSI benefits from the Federal Government because , like Mr. Romney 's running mate Paul Ryan , their moms or dads died when they were young . <p> The 2.9 million retired American Veterans who , like John McCain served honorably for twenty or more years and receive military pensions from the Federal Government . <p> The 36 million retired American workers who , like former President Reagan 's wife Nancy , qualify for Social Security from the Federal Government . <p> The 2.9 million disabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were injured in the line of duty and receive disability payments from the Federal Government . <p> Have a nice day . <p> Joe <p> September 19 , 2012 at 3:08 pm <p> Ken Daniels <p> What does Mitt Romney have to do to right the ship ? He needs to let it sink all the way to the bottom ( where it is currently heading ) and let it rest on the ocean floor where it will level off . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 3:08 pm <p> Ken Daniels <p> What does Mitt Romney have to do to right the ship ?

I am one of the " 47% " but pay taxes on SS and other income at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest joke I 've seen in many years of living and does not deserve nor is he qualified to be President . In my eyes , he ca n't right the ship but maybe he can get a hint from the Captain of that liner that sank and jump overboard , today . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 3:15 pm <p> Annie , Atlanta <p> I said this before in one of your previous posts . He needed , before the campaign got into full swing , to live in a third floor walk up in NYC , with Ann , without limos and jets , where they would have to feed themselves on the equivalent of what 2 people get on food stamps , for a month , to understand real people , not just the country club set he 's only been exposed to all his life . Just have to ask , however did we get to a place where a man wants to be our president yet disdains half of us and does n't want to pay his fair share of taxes ? ( Does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> September 19 , 2012 at 3:17 pm <p> David in Mississippi <p> The seas are rough out there for both canidates . The passengers rush from one side to the other and the ship rocks with them . If Mitt would stand mid deck and speak what he belives , instead of just being a talking head , he might find out that most of us want what will right the ship and put us on a steady course . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 3:17 pm <p> BudT <p> Romneys ' ship is already right , although , it would sure help his cause if he would loose the role of " Attack Dog " . Those who vote for the health and well being of America will vote for Romney ; those who vote for themselves will vote for Obama , but then there is the ' swing vote " that may decide who becomes President . Romney must be " likeable " to win those critical votes . People do n't like a negative person , Obama is a positive person , although somewhat a dreamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 47% who will vote for Obama because of what they get .. or can get .. from the treasury of this Republic .

I do n't think he has it at all . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 3:36 pm <p> C from Boston , MA <p> He needs to step aside and let another Republican take over the ticket at this point . He can not win if he has already dismissed half of the electorate . <p> IF he released the past 12 years of tax returns , that might actually stop the current discussion about the videos , but since he has n't already , that 's just replacing one boondoggle with another boondoggle . <p> Actually talking about the economy with no side trips to Egypt and Libya and other matters of foreign policy , and actually talking about specifics might help .

But that would n't work , not with the presidential debate coming up . Plus he has to have high visibility to stand a chance . I 've actually wondered if he is trying to " throw " the election , but the fact is he wants to be president really bad . And Ann Romney wants it even more ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 3:56 pm <p> Larry in Houston <p> What does Mitt Romney have to do to right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " stay the course " all that stuff is small potatoes by the time election day rolls around . people will end up forgetting about that stuff . It 's too bad that when the debates start , Romney ca n't have Gingrich to take care of the debates for him . Gingrich would sweep the floor with Obama , but , unfortunately for Newt , he could n't carry the sunshine state , because Romney unleashed a barrage of ads that had a cost of tens of millions , and held the Newter under water for weeks , before he came up for air , not to mention that Gingrich had so much baggage , he would have sunk an aircraft carrier . Obama will end up out witting , and out talking Romney in the Debates I 'm afraid . " Stay the Course " -- only problem is that it wo n't be like Reagan vs . Carter , where he was defeated by Reagan by a landslide . He will end up edging out Obama with just a handful of Votes , and hopefully the supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the election to Bush , instead of Gore . Vote Democrat -- 2012 ( for the " working " middle class ) <p> September 19 , 2012 at 3:57 pm <p> Brian , San Diego <p> What he should have done from the beginning was take a clear stand on the issues and stick to it . Buck the conservative wing of his party on some of the social issues , and prove to the country both that he is n't an extremist and that he is n't afraid to stand up to the Tea Party . He should have challenged them from the start , and dared them to risk letting Obama win if they did n't like it . At this point , though , he 's trapped by his own actions ; any major change will just be seen as another flip-flop . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 3:59 pm <p> Paul in NC <p> Are you kidding ? Righting the Romney ship at this point is tantamount to raising the Titanic . This seriously flawed candidate and his inept staff has bungled every issue from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car funeral .

One gaffe after another one just shows that how much is he out of touch with average American 's struggles . First , he has no backbone to stand up for his principle . Everything is for sale in his mind to get to the President 's chair . Second , he likes to bet for $10,000 , his wife drives couple of Cadillacs , He thinks poor students should borrow money to goto school and he thinks retired people who paid into social security are freeloaders : ) <p> Why would anyone , other than 1% , want him to represent US with this type of mentality ? People voting for him are not really voting for him , they are voting against Obama who is a principled decent man compared to Romney . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:12 pm <p> Susan <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a candidate out way the actions of a President .

As far as I 'm concerned , Romney showed his true self and true beliefs at that fund raising party . He seems like a guy who wants to be president , but only just because . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , and assumed that voters would simply fall for his " trust me " line , rather than require substance . As for the 47% remark , it 's beyond contemptible and Romney has made it clear he could give a flying fig about anyone who he decides is a mooch . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:15 pm <p> s in fl <p> Maybe he should get one of those cute little sailor 's cap like the " real " Thurtson Howell III used to wear . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:15 pm <p> c robinson <p> Gov . Romney would do well to decide what he really believes in and state his case for how he would put into place the lofty ideas he has without always trying to denigrate his opponent .

I wonder ... the 1% who want more tax breaks , or the 99% out of a job with kids to feed . Yeah , they 'll vote for Romney for that promised 12 million jobs .

The 47 percent of the people that he speaks of includes African Americans , Latinos , seniors , and military service members who daily place thier lives on the line for the safety of Americans , and others in the world . This statement by the candidate should be a wake up call to anyone who thinks that thier vote does not matter . President Obama said on Letterman that 47 percent of the vote was given to John McCain in the 2008 election . he went on to say that even though they did nt vote for him , he heard thier voice , and works to be the best president for them also . That is presidental , that is honorable . That is why President Obama will be there four more years . Give it up Mitt .

The facts are that more people are unemployed and dependant on the government since this incompetant president took office . The fact is that if Obama is reelected , we can expect more of the same -- MORE UNEMPLOYEMENT , HIGHER DEFICIT AND MORE PEOPLE DEPENDANT ON GOVERNMENT ..... Not a pretty picture ! ! ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:23 pm <p> Maria <p> Stick a fork in this man , he is done . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:24 pm <p> Jeff <p> Pretty much impossible to right the ship . The only way he could have won the general election would have been by not bowing down to the ultra conservatives in the GOP which would have cost him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . Until the level headed middle take back their party they will continue to falter . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:24 pm <p> George <p> Concede . Here is a man who privately says he does n't care about almost half the country . A man who I doubt lost any sleep when he closed up US businesses and gave those jobs to people in other countries . A man who hides his money offshore so he does n't have to pay taxes -- taxes that might go to keep a federal employee employed ; contribute to the hiring of VA doctors who can help the troops coming home with PTSD ; offset some of the costs of required medication for a retiree who cant afford it . He is un-American . Anyone else doing what he has done would be accused of Treason . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:24 pm <p> chris <p> Since this is the REAL MItt Romney ( and we 've been waiting years to actually see him ) - it is imossible to right the ship without complete lies and utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in BIG trouble ! ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:24 pm <p> Richard <p> Try again in 2016 ) <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:24 pm <p> David in Dallas <p> Jack , It 's too late !

HA ... they LOVE war and conflict it makes for the business bottom line that Mitt and his ilk so cherish .. <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:25 pm <p> Ken in NC <p> He can right the ship just like he parted the Red Sea . DUH . OOOoops .. sorry Mitt , that was Charlton Heston <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:25 pm <p> Jyothi , St.Louis , MO <p> Apology and Sorry are just to name a few terms Romney needs add to his vocabulary . They come handy when trying to convince the 47% that he has referred to a million times . His reaction to others ' remarks about him should be at least as fast as his remarks about the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the ' failed to fix the economy ' , ' repealing the Obamacare ' . Hurry up ! Only seven weeks away ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:25 pm <p> Roger in Dallas <p> It 's too late Jack . The ship is sinking and there are not enough lifeboats left . Had this latest fiasco not happened perhaps he could have done something but when he feels 47% of us are parasites living off the government , he has not earned the right to even be considered for the office of POTUS . Case closed . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:26 pm <p> Eric Hatch ( Loveland OH ) <p> Not unless he mans the pumps right along with all those citizens whose contributions to America - raising families , working hard all their lives and retiring on Social Security , fighting in Republican-sponsored wars - " takers " like those folks - and , of course , he wo n't do that . Might get his hands calloused . Ooooh . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:26 pm <p> Bill in Ottawa <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tea Partiers it is now " adult time " and they must stop their tantrums . 2 ) Admit publicly that governance requires compromise and bi-partisan co-operation . 3 ) Concede that all avenues of dealing with the deficit are on the table , including tax hikes . 4 ) Take a class in what benefits government brings to a society , and write an essay on why those benefits are required . 5 ) Spent one month living in a household of average Americans , with no extra money working as a greeter at Walmart. 6 ) Drop his current insurance coverage and then get new policies including for his wife 's existing conditions on the average American income <p> That should fix things in time for the election . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:26 pm <p> khemare <p> That 47 percent will turn into the fastest 270 electoral votes for Peresident Obama that the nation has ever seen .

And as part of the 47% that support the President almost no matter what , please note that I DO pay income taxes and aside from six months of unemployment during the Reagan " recovery " , I 'm not dependent on the Feds and do n't feel entitled to it . But I also believe that the American Dream is created through a partnership of business and government and that neither works well at all without the other . And for the record , I 'm a 60-year old white guy who goes to church nearly every week and voted for every Republican Presidential candidate from Nixon to Bush 41 the first time . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:27 pm <p> veep <p> The Republican Party is a coalition of logically inconsistent factions . <p> There is no way to honestly unite them . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:27 pm <p> Dieter <p> In his mind , he is probably doing just great ..... raising funds ! ! !

He was right on , and Obama has mismanaged the middle east like no other president . Where is the media coverage on this . I guess if you tell a lie long enough , someone might believe it is true . <p> Instead of the 6 trillion Obama racked up in deficit spending in 4 years , to create a false American economy . Which by the way , is twice the rate of George Bush , and the economy is still on a crash course , and unemployment is so high . Good Job Obama , keep buying votes . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:29 pm <p> Felix , Dallas TX <p> Mitt has to quit his campaign and let Paul Ryan run it . He is paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a backbone .

I 'm not talking about have a number of homes in various state or have their person jet with a pilot standing by . He wants people to vote for him as he dines on foie gras and caviar while people home to afford cake . It a way , he 's as much out of touch as Sarah Palin . <p> September 19 , 2012 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " entitled " 47% ; my wife and I will pay over $30,000 in federal income taxes this year . However , my mother is retired , her Social Security income is non-taxable , and her investment earnings are insufficient to have her paying federal income taxes . Damn right she 's entitled to her Social Security and Medicare benefits . She and my dad paid into both programs for half a century . They both worked hard and struggled to provide me with the kind of education that has enabled me to earn a pretty good income . I resent like hell having her demeaned as some sort of parasite . And I bet I 'm not the only member of the " 53% Club " to feel that way . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:29 pm <p> Ron , denver <p> Jack sometimes you just have to turn the ship around , go home and dry dock it ! ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:29 pm <p> Michael A Yeboah <p> nothing , the ship has already sunk <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win all three debates to get back in a position to where he can claim he is a credible candidate .

Forwarding a predatory capitalist money manipulator as a candidate -- Mitt Romney- was a huge Republican mistake .

Remember the days of the GOP primaries ? There was a parade of #1 picks ... one after another .... Michelle Bachmann , Newt Gingrich , Rick Santorum , remember Rick Perry ? ... one after another . I consider this to be the most pathetic line-up of presidential hopefuls in US history . The GOP was desparate to nominate Anyone but Mitt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romney is who they got stuck with anyway .... now we are seeing the bald truth of why the GOP was willing to put up with the other nominees .... and why they felt .... Please ! ANYONE BUT MITT ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:31 pm <p> Ken in Kingsport <p> Governor Romney probably can not ' right the ship ' . He is most likely a fairly good family man , good businessman , and an average politician . But he appears to have a problem in that he is so far out of touch with most Americans , he can not do it . This is a man who was raised with the proverbial silver spoon and has never really understood what it is to struggle . It hurts him badly and , combined with his refusal to talk with specifics about his policies , he can not right the ship . I 'm one of those ' Independents ' they are trying to sway . I do n't plan to vote for either one of the Straussian candidates from their respective circus/party unless they start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform : 1 ) shutting down the Fed ; 2 ) completely restructuring the tax code ; 3 ) campaign finance reform ( revision to Constitution ) ; and 4 ) Congressional term limits with 10 year ban on working for K-Street after leaving office ( revision to Constitution ) . Americans are going to wake up to the corruption within these two Straussian circuses and their plutocracy . <p> To right this ship Mitt has to get deckhands from one of those countries he outsourced jobs to . but do nt tell them in his eyes they will be a part of the 47 percent he does not give a damn about . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:32 pm <p> Bella Pekie <p> The only thing that I could see Mitt Romney doing to " right the ship " of his presidential campaign is to grow a soul and change political parties between now and election day . As an **40;2730;TOOLONG ... voter , I had high hopes for Romney in the beginning of the primaries . And then I heard him vacate every major conviction he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Add to his untrustworthiness a Republican party who eagerly disenfranchises all but grumpy old white , heterosexual , wealthy men and the religious Right , and I do n't see myself voting for the GOP in any election for the foreseeable future . -- Bella , Moscow , Idaho <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:32 pm <p> cincinnatidavid <p> Jack , surely you realize that Mitt has no ship to right . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:33 pm <p> FourleafTayback <p> The " Ship " is America ... and Obama has run us aground and is trying to sink us . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:34 pm <p> Dan <p> Sorry Mitt -- like the Titanic , the deck chairs have all been arranged and the life boats all been lowered . <p> Dan Boston , MA <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:34 pm <p> Bill in VA <p> Anything is possible Jack .

What do you mean he 's done that already ? " <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:35 pm <p> Chad Albus <p> Jack , In order to ' right the ship ' Governor Romney must first dredge the sea in which it has sunk . Chad Fairfax VA <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:35 pm <p> AJ , Rocky Hill CT <p> Withdraw from the race immediately . His ship has hit an iceberg and taken on too much water . He can grab the lifeboat or go down with the ship . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:35 pm <p> Wm Thompson <p> The Mitt-ster is having trouble connecting . He 's a deal maker trying to close the deal .

His interpretation of the speech is worse than his speech . The ship is too sunk to straighten ! The Republicans like Senator Heller is already off the ship . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:36 pm <p> Bob <p> Start over . Actually work and pay for his education and lifestyle , rather than having it handed to him by wealthy parents . Actually start a business and build it , rather than being installed in an executive position based on dad 's connections . Actually use his money to start businesses and employ people rather than hiding it in foreign countries to avoid taxes . Maybe study something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe actually create something of value , just once , rather than being an entitled leech . Were he to do all of these things , however , he probably would n't be a republican . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:36 pm <p> Jack NYC <p> Jack -- This is ironic . You ask how Romney can right the ship . That 's the problem . His ship is listing a bit too much ( well , a lot really ) to the right . To continue the nautical metaphor -- he needs to list a bit more to the left and get himself in center . He 's " listing " too much to the extreme of his party . Jack NYC <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:36 pm <p> **35;2772;TOOLONG <p> Mitt Romney needs to repent . Whether you are for him or not , the man still comes off and across as arrogant and entitled .

He needs a good dose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cafferty ; it will sink . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:36 pm <p> Billy Hill , VA <p> Romney is none and done ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:36 pm <p> Doug <p> Jack , too late to right the ship . Time to make a MAYDAY call . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:37 pm <p> Christopher Henkels <p> There is no debate . Mitt Romney is neither entirely trustworthy nor does he seem presidential . He has dismantled any notion he may have a clue about the intricacies of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , he flagrantly talks about use of dirty bombs by terrorists , he freely dismisses half the american population as a group he does not care to think about or even try and govern , its just goes on and on . He does not have strong convictions on any substantial issue except relying on tax breaks fixing the economy . We are at historically low tax levels so clearly this is n't the solution .... Either is he . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:37 pm <p> stephen matuszak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote in a booth , Best chance to find a Journalist , and Best chance to right america . <p> 2012 at 4:37 pm <p> Amused <p> I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again , The President is playing chess while the Romney campaign is playing checkers . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:37 pm <p> Valerie , Florida <p> I think the to Mr. Rommney 's campaign it that , he does n't appear to have a vision or a committment to the ' policies " that he speaks of . I was n't a big fan of President Bush , but you always knew where he stood and he was committed to and believed in what he was saying , ( wether it was right or wrong ) . There is a percieved lack of empathy from Mr. Romney , one can infer from many of his statements that he equates personal wealth means you are a " good ' person , a hard worker more honerable , etc and if you are poor it 's because you have n't worked hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servicemembers who qualify for and recieve food stamps . A rational person does n't resent others wealth , but what we do resent is the implication that money alone somehow makes one superior . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:38 pm <p> JoeTheITGuy <p> This does n't look good ... Mitt is in trouble .... just wait for the debates ! ! ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:38 pm <p> Ellen Johnson <p> Sorry . It 's too late for Romney . All he is doing now is changing chairs on the Titanic . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:38 pm <p> Mary <p> Jack , I 'm not sure he can right the ship . Especially if he keeps blowing holes in it . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:38 pm <p> wolfpackbob <p> It is The Economy , Mr. President . Your Economy , Mr. President . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:38 pm <p> Mark in Seattle <p> Robme never had a chance . He and his mrs are so very blue blood . They need to take their silver spoons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2012 at 4:39 pm <p> ddblah <p> The way I see is that it 's not the ship that needs to be righted . It 's the Romney who really needs a heavy make over , from head to toe . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:40 pm <p> Matt , Miami <p> Right the ship ? He 's already too far to the right . Any more move to the right and he will disappear from the political landscape . He 's a quitter like he intimated about his views about the Middle East regarding the Palestinians . It would't be too soon for him to quit his run for the presidency and let somebody else get a chance to run America ! USA ! USA USA ! Romney does n't deserve leadership of America . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:40 pm <p> pkfops <p> May be tough since most of the " 47% " live in Red States . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:40 pm <p> realitybite <p> There is an underlying story here . Let 's forget about the accuracy of Romney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall on deaf ears because people who do n't pay taxes would n't accept his message . Have you wondered what that message would have to be for those people to reject it ? Logically and necessarily , the message must be about raising taxes on the people who are " not paying " income tax . BUT , Romney insisted that he wo n't raise taxes on the middle class , or anyone for that matter . So , he is infact , contradicting himself ( yet again ! ) . So , either he is not accurate about the 47% , and lied to the people there , or he has lied to everyone else about raising taxes . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:41 pm <p> Peter Peay <p> It is not the government 's responsibility to redistribute wealth -- that 's the job of the banks and wall street . Problem is , they only want upward redistribution . The rich get richer at the expense of middle America <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:41 pm <p> Mike in TX <p> The real Mitt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that the 47% to 49% that will vote for Pres. Obama and not him are not taking responsibility for their lives along with claiming all are dependent on the govt. and that is the only reason they vote for someone . I suspect a huge amount of hard working Democrats would argue that . The other issue is 47% do n't pay taxes and wo n't listen to him either so , even though they are retired seniors , millionaires , republicans and democrats he wo n't have to be responsible for governing them either . But keep in mind he wo n't split the country by class . He does not have what it takes to be President of us all . Bottom line is he keeps on taking on more water and is not likely to change . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:41 pm <p> gloria <p> Jack <p> Yes he can . He is not sugar coating everything which is a good thing . The article from Mother Jones , was incomplete and they pieced together segments with I believe 2 mnutes were missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over Mitt Romney , that they should be sure of their facts before they tear into someone . This will come back and bite them in the heels . <p> I am always hearing from cnn msnbc etc we have not checked this so we can not confirm . In this case they did n't even bother <p> I am from Canada and have no bone in this issue , however , I am an avid follower of your political system and find this to be terribly inaccurate .. <p> Have a great Day ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:41 pm <p> vatoloke <p> He can right the ship by jumping out of it pdq . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:41 pm <p> Q <p> I 'm an Independent . He called me " emotional " . Enough said . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:42 pm <p> Burnham <p> Walk the plank . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:42 pm <p> Burbank <p> I do n't think there is much Romney can do at this point . He 's a bull in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'm putting my money on Gary Johnson . Great track record , not a puppet like the other two , and has a lot of common sense . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:43 pm <p> squosh1110 <p> Romeny 's only chance to right the ship , is too embrace the gaffe 's . It 's obvious they are an extension of who he is and how he really feels . His only hope is to try to convince voters that he 's right . I do n't think he has a chance of doing it , but it 's his only option . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:43 pm <p> Ian in MN <p> Romney ca n't right this ship because the only way to do it is be honest with the American people and have genuinely superior ideas for solving their problems than his opposition does . Unfortunately those two things are contradictory because to be honest with the American people would require him to admit that Obama 's policies are n't the problem . Republicans like him are the problem . <p> September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need 's to be quiet .. this guy is trying to be a middle class citizen . but when he speaks , the real Mitt comes out .. selfish.rude and can never be challenged .. he wants to be the president of the 1% ..... elderly .. kids and veterans are not freeloaders or Victims ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:44 pm <p> tony <p> Congratulations to the Conservatives who fought and paid for " Citizens United " . They did n't think a Filthy Richer Clod would take their Primaries away before they got to buy the election . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:44 pm <p> DT <p> Mitt Romney needs to buy a robot clone of himself and program it to say the right things so that he can win the election . Or , he could buy the company that manufactures the voter machines . Or , he could make sure nobody brings cell phones / recording devices to his speaking engagements . These are good political tools that should win voters over . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:44 pm <p> James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thats always a great quality for a man as president .... maybe people do n't realize the kind of backlash that can come from something the president just says .... like it or not ... people around the worls take it very seriously ...... Mitt has already offended allies and he is n't even president ..... such a scary thing to look at that this man could become the leader of the free world <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:45 pm <p> Nan , Nevada <p> Now that Romney has pulled away the veil on his real beliefs , there is n't much he CAN do to right his badly listing ship . All has now been revealed to the voters and they do NOT like what they see ! Lots of luck Mittens ! ! ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:45 pm <p> Fuzzbee <p> There 's nothing he can do , he simply lacks the required skill set to be President of the United States . His inability to connect with most people is now easy to fathom -- he does n't like or respect half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to be President , his vaunted business sense , is neither a good reason to elect a President nor a substitute for the real emotional &; moral leadership needed for the job . This man lacks the charm , the spontaneity , the street sense , the soul &; the wisdom to be President . He 's toast . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:45 pm <p> Adam - Florida <p> At this late point in the game , I think Romney has cooked is own goose . What makes his last gaffe especially bad is that it was done at some private event , that only the very rich were able to attend . It really makes you wonder what this man says to the elite that run this country and everyone else . Even though Romney has tried to walk away from these comments , I think he has no where to go but down from here . The only people who will vote for Romney are those who were going to anyways . The only way Romney will come back is if Obama has a worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I would n't expect that . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:45 pm <p> Marjorie <p> Speak the truth and show his tax return ! .......... oops , then of course he would loose the White House . <p> Atlanta <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:46 pm <p> Sara <p> What Peggy Noonan is saying invalidates Romney from the presidency ! Do we want a President who ca n't handle a news conference ? Do we want a President who keeps sticking his foot in his mouth ! Do we want a President who has to surround himself with others in order to give himself gravitas ! America -- do n't make a mistake and hire another George W. Bush ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:46 pm <p> Mike <p> When a real ship needs righted , there are two choices : pump the water out of the low side or counter flood the high side . Pumping out is the better choice but it only works if the source of the flooding can be controlled . The quicker and more often used approach , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's case pumping out wo n't work -- the water is coming in faster than he can pump it out and it is safe to assume that further damage will occur . To counter flood is a bold approach , as it both rights the ship and brings it closer to sinking . Romney needs to drop his " I 'll tell you after I 'm elected " approach , stop wasting time trying to sink Obama , and actually lay out details on job creation , tax plans , entitlement reform , military spending , and foreign policy . The debates are the perfect vehicle for this and his last chance before his campaign capsizes . The voters who are still in play are the ones who will listen to details , both sides have long ago locked up the majority of voters who settle for a slogan or decide based on attack ads . <p> Romney does n't have to do anything other than state the facts about obama , it is the liberal media who is sinking him . Saying that 47% pay no tax is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never vote for him is also not a gaffe it is the truth , they hate him . Obama spent 100 millon in ads saying romney only paid a 14% tax rate in 2011 , but now the media is saying 47% including the rich pay 0 tax . Romney paid 14 times the tax rate of 47% of the population . The problem facing the country is the 100 trillion dollar federal debt when you include ss/medicare/medicaid not the so called romney gaffes . The question is when is the media going to say obama has a problem . Obama has been the president for almost 4yrs. and the poor have gotten poorer , the middle class has lost income , the debt has increased 5 trillion , 50% of new college grads ca n't find work , 23 million are unemployed or under employed , gas has gone up 2 dollars a gallon , the bank saving accounts only pay 0.1% thanks to bernanke who was appointed by obama , and food is up 20% but yet the media ca n't find any problem with obama . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media about romney having problems and gaffes . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:47 pm <p> Sara from New Jersey <p> Jack , <p> What Peggy Noonan is saying about Romney basically invalidates him from the Presidency . Do we want a President who ca n't handle a news conference ! Do we want a President who keeps sticking his foot in his mouth ! Do we want a President who has to surround himself with other better politicans in order to give himself gravitas ! America -- do n't make a mistake and hire another George W. Bush ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:48 pm <p> Bill , Bloomington Il <p> People do nt like and do nt want the truth Jack and Obamas response to the mid-east crisis was typically weak <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:48 pm <p> Terry in Virginia <p> The Romneys ' disdain for the middle class and poor has now come across loud and clear . We are not old chewing gum stuck on their shoes trying to get a free ride . It 's interesting that Mr. Romney talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality is that Mr. Romney 's excuse for not releasing his tax returns is that he does n't want to be a " victim " of the press and Democrats . The working poor , seniors , retired vets , and many of the rest of us are not victims - we 're too busy working and struggling to survive to play the victim card . So , for this Independent voter , Mr. Romney ca n't right the ship until he apologizes to the hardworking men , women , seniors , and veterans of this country for insulting our work ethic . Unfortunately , Mr. Romney , like many in the GOP , seems allergic to apologies . We teach our children that when they hurt or insult someone they need to apologize . It 's hard sometimes . Plus , it takes courage and integrity to apologize , something that , sadly , the GOP has lost . For the record , it 's not just Mr. Romney who 's sinking the GOP 's ship . The GOP has been punching holes in the hull since the 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate and partisanship to see the damage that they 've done to themselves . Many voted for everything that got us into this mess and now they 're lying about their own records . When the GOP ship sinks , it may be Mr. Romney at the helm but he wo n't be the reason why they sank - he just drifted off course . It will be all the GOP baggage on board along with those holes that finally did it . Money , power , and greed has destroyed the GOP . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:48 pm <p> Tracy <p> Mitt Romney has to admit that there are 47% of people who need government help . He also has to admit this is not a negative under the current economic conditions . What he has to focus on to get back on track , is how he will help the 47% to achieve their dreams . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:48 pm <p> jean2009 <p> You have to be kidding right ? In the 47% that pays no income tax are 4000 millionaires . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there also goes his donor base . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:48 pm <p> Ryan from Cross Lanes , WV <p> For Mitt to right the ship he first needs to get off of it . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:49 pm <p> Larry L <p> Romney 's campaign was doomed by three miscalculations . <p> 1 . Republicans assumed independent voters would n't punish them for blocking all progress and not assuming any blame for the recession . Americans do n't like disloyalty to the people and did n't fall for the " It 's all Obama 's fault " B.S .. <p> 2 . The second miscalculation also deals with the Republican assessment of the awareness of independent voters . They tried to run Romney as a conservative ( he is n't ) in the primary and a right-of-center candidate in the general . Americans do n't like a flip-flopper . Romney 's only position was " against everything " and he presented no vision . His failure to produce his tax returns raised too many questions -- this 47% comment sealed the deal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra-right-wing . This group 's baggage with women , minorities , labor unions , gay people , environmentalists , and anybody other than angry , white Christians drove the final nail in Ronmey 's coffin . The GOP is largely dead in the America of the future . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:49 pm <p> mercfan <p> I not sure he really wants to right the ship . <p> A lot of people call candidates from opposing parties out of touch all the time . The only true example I can recall is when GH Bush did n't know how much a loaf of bread or gallon of milk costs when he ran for his 2nd term -- but Romney goes way beyond any of that . <p> I think he knows he ca n't fix our problems and now he knows it 's down to him an Obama . Ever since it was apparent he was going to be the GOP nominee , it 's been one mistake after another . For months , he keeps putting his foot in his mouth both here and abroad . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 at 4:50 pm <p> AC Thomas <p> Mitt Romney truly cares about winning this election he needs to apologize to all Republicans in that 47% ; especially to the folks who look up to him because of his social conservatism . Americans decide their president with their hearts ; he is killing the heart of his campaign by not apologizing , and catering to hardcore right who will vote for him no matter what . But you ca n't win an election with 30% of vote ... ARITHMETIC ! He will never win this election ... by not apologizing , he is basically doing three things : - ( a ) The hardcore republicans in that 47% who are insulted ... who will go to the pole on Nov 6th and vote for him , but will feel like they have no other choice . They are good people who depends on welfare , Medicare , Medicaid , and social security , who is accepting these benefits because of dire needs -- which means they are not exited about Romney presidency , they do n't feel it in their hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( b ) The independents who are mostly undecided will go to the poles and vote for Obama because they too feel like they do n't have much of a choice , so they will vote for Obama because they believe Romney will never understand their struggles by these statements and not apologizing , ( c ) By not apologizing he is helping democratic ( house and senate race ) campaigns to point out to the American people that he is just an arrogant rich elitist who only care about winning election to help his rich friends , and give tax cut for the 1% . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:50 pm <p> Elizabeth Collins <p> Do n't know if he can right the ship.Every time he speaks of the cuff he puts his foot in his mouth all the way to the hip.If ( big if ) Mitt the Twit suddenly became gaffe free everyone would know it 's not him talking , but rather his handlers.When he speaks off the cuff that 's the real Mitt.Why have n't we heard more from people that had him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits.When was the last time he had to decide between food or medication or a light bill.Hell when was the last time he shopped at Wal Mart ? <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:50 pm <p> Michael C. Robinson <p> This is the same ship which was not right against John McCain . " Righting " his ship , would assume at some point it was " right " . Unfortunately for Willard , his ship has never sailed correctly . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:50 pm <p> Frank Poynton from Los Angeles <p> Note to Peggy Noonan : On your advise to Mitt Romney about surrounding himself with a " posse of top republicans " and making speeches that " have to be big . " You might as well advise him on how to install fire hydrants in hell . Its fitting advise because his campaign is going down in blazes . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:50 pm <p> EZRA <p> What does Romney need to do to right the ship . Drop out of the race , for one . <p> September 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifeboat ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:51 pm <p> Kim from Midland , MI <p> Jack , I can not help but remember the last scene of Hitchcock 's thriller " Niagara " . The cry goes out to " SCUTTLE IT ! " as a small boat surges toward the deadly Niagara Falls , with 2 people on board . They manage to take on enough water to slow the boat down and the pretty girl manages to get out before that last pitch down the mighty falls . What I am trying to figure out is , who will get out of the Romney boat if they manage to slow it down . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:51 pm <p> AL in West Palm Beach <p> Jack , what should Romney do ? Let 's see , Romney should know this much : " You do n't criticize poor people while they are in the room serving you food and drinks . " If he fails to understand that he should do what he sent Paul Ryan to ask Todd Akin . Since he wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it for him . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:51 pm <p> Cassie Turner <p> He ca n't do anything to correct who he really is . That 's his problem . American 's are finally seeing the real Mitt Romney through his various cracks and we do n't like what we see . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:52 pm <p> Jack Barnes <p> Jack , <p> I do n't think Mitt Romney is worried about righting the ship . He 'd rather board his private yacht to the Cayman Islands to stash more loot he made raiding companies , outsourcing jobs and not paying taxes . He is making George W. look smart . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:53 pm <p> sarge <p> Get out and swim , otherwise Ryan will also drown ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:54 pm <p> Mark in San Jose CA <p> I 'm afraid the GOP ship just took a huge hit across the bow in the middle of some very stormy seas and is now quickly taking on water out there . His campaign needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear message of facts and policy details and support of his party and tax returns rather than trying to fix it all on the trail with gaffes which also seem to be swinging into the sides of this sinking ship . Those tax returns are the 9th life in this campaign ... better for him to release them than someone else and try to keep paddling . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:54 pm <p> James Mayfield <p> The US electorate has a sixth sense about people running for office . We are not a dumb as we are frequently treated This is especially true of swing voters . Swing voters are not bound to a party ; yet , we care enough to vote and to carefully consider who we trust and their values . Obama is not perfect ! But , Romney routinely demonstrates his only value is his self interest . The voters , particularly swing voters have figured this out . Romney 's failure as a candidate is not about how he is running his campaign , it is about his lack of being ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be covered up with attack ads and surrounding him with more trust worthy Republicans . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:54 pm <p> Henry Mendoza <p> How can you right a sinking ship ? Mr. Romney is so out of touch of the daily strugles that the poor and middle class of our country faces everyday that in his mind he can not comprehend the nature of it or accept its existence . His only reality is the balance sheet of his wealthy friends and the bottom line of their bank account without regards of the quality of life of the poor and middle class citizens of this great country . Mr. Romney your ship is getting to the bottom ... is sinking ! <p> Henry -- New Jersey <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:54 pm <p> Nan <p> Get a labotomy ? Sorry , he is who he is and there is no amount of money that can change that . Let him stick with the business world and leave the country and world 's affairs to a more mature and steady candidate , Obama . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LA <p> He can steady the ship but since it is headed in the wrong direction , it wo n't do any good . " For the people , by the people of the people " . This means we help one another . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:54 pm <p> John from North Carolina <p> Instead of " righting the ship " , I think a more appropriate question would be what 's the difference between the Romney campaign and the Titanic . <p> Answer : The Titanic had a band . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:54 pm <p> Ratt Stone <p> Uhh , Hey Cafferty , I have not met one Conservative that was put off by Romney telling the truth about the majority of Obama 's supporters . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:55 pm <p> KLARGAR <p> In order to right the ship he should go to work in the wonderful factory in China that he so glowingly spoke about , but only if he can get over the barbed wire fence that is keeping out all the other workers who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just imagine the factory owner telling hiim this and this vapid piece of crap actualy believing it . He also needs to apologize to our brave veterans who are disabled and included in the 47% of victims that he speaks of . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:55 pm <p> GFJ <p> Jack if he would have moved more towards the center and taken a more moderate conservative approach he would have snagged a fair portion of the of the President 's votes . Instead he aligned with the hardline conservative gas bags that have led the man down a path which he can not turn back . He 's changed his position so many times in order to win a portion of the electorate that he will be viewed not genuine and shifty . Furthermore his leadership character is now being questioned . Why would or how could you let yourself get down this path ? He 's presenting himself as another puppet President like we had for 8 years . However this time the people see it and are smarter , madder and fed up with the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> AB <p> Mr. Romney is in a quandry where he can not turn his troubled campaign around . Romney has critized President Obama 's program on fixing the economy , but he has no viable alternative solution . The tax cut program has been tried years ago and has not worked . In fact , that program has put the economy and country into a ditch . Obama has taken the country and economy out of that ditch and has saved the American auto industry from bankrupcy and extinction . If we followed Romney 's advise on the auto industry , there would be no American auto industry today . Romney has shown that he is really out of touch with most Americans and does not care about them or their problems . Running a business is not comparable to running the country and fixing an ailing economy by putting people back to work . Romney has put people out of work . After all , he like to fire people . He got rich at the expense of rendering people unemployed . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road and be more of a statesman rather than approach the electorate with " he said it ... he did it ... " sound bites that seem petty and cheap . The President has 4 years of tangible decisions behind him ( whether good or bad is debatable ) ; Romney has to match up by bringing some tangible plans for the future to the table . Unless he brings some positivity to the campaign , the electorate will go to the polling booth with a bad taste in their mouth . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:56 pm <p> RickFromDetroit <p> Call in air strikes on the ship , while he is at the helm . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:56 pm <p> Eric <p> Romney is up in the latest Rasmussen poll . He is tied in Virginia , Florida and Ohio . According to Rasmussen he is up in New Hampshire , Colorado and North Carolina . If he rights the ship this will be a landslide . <p> How about come clean to the American people and disclose his tax returns . Just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> John <p> Why does it never occur to Republicans that Romney is just a genuinely bad person ? <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:57 pm <p> qbawb <p> Really ? Are you expecting that ANY OR ALL of the 47% are about to be stricken by MASS AMNESIA ? You really think that Mitt can " right the ship ? " Like we 're gon na believe him NOW ! ! ! Yea right ! NOT A SNOWBALL 'S CHANCE IN .......... <p> Mitt Romney is ballast . Throw him overboard and the ship will right itself . <p> Terry in SC <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:58 pm <p> Jim <p> Jack , it 's as if Romney decided the country is so fouled up it can no longer be fixed , so he no longer wants the job . Once an egg is broken and scrambled , there 's no putting it back together . Too bad , for the yolk 's on us . <p> Jim Rome , GA <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:58 pm <p> Gurgyl <p> Just steer the ship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let in . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:59 pm <p> Gloria <p> Just get out of the race , Mitt . The ship would be right immediately ! Oh , and the GOP may as well just forfeit the election to President Obama . <p> Obama/Biden 2012 <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:59 pm <p> Greg Cox of Bremerton , WA <p> Romney was " spot on " in my opinion . Handouts , giveaways ... redistritubtion ... equals the Democratic Party . My handout to them is to vote Republican for the first time in a long time . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 4:59 pm <p> Heather Jones <p> It does n't matter , Jack . Romney and Obama are two sides of the same coin . A big government Republican is no better than big government Democrat . We need REAL change in this country , and the two party system is n't going to get us there . Both are beholden to corporation and special interest group lobbyists . In this case , taking the " red pill " or the " blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies . GARY JOHNSON 2012 ! ! ! ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:00 pm <p> Lou Scott <p> It 's not possible . He is who he is . He 's unlikable and he does n't like most Americans , and we now know it . He does n't care enough about our young men and women in Afghanistan to even mention them at the Republican Convention . He does n't have the class or the restraint to keep himself from saying untrue and inappropriate comments when our people are being attacked and killed on foreign soil . He has proven himself to be a fool many times over . That ship ai n't rightin itself . It is what it is . An ugly ship full of holes . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:00 pm <p> Jim in Denver , CO <p> Jack , Right the ship ? ? He left the dry dock wth a hole in the side . Just rearranging the chairs on the deck . Stick a fork in him , he 's done ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking on water when it left the harbor ( Repubican Convention ) . The only thing left to do is abandon ship . Captain Mitt ca n't save his own ship of fools . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:00 pm <p> Sad4Willis <p> Are there some people who play the system ? Of course , and there always will be . Most people just need a hand up and take advantage of the safety net that society has put in place . Should efforts be made to ferret out those who can actually work and be a productive part of society but choose to let others do for them ? Absolutely ! But to paint everyone with the same brush is just not well thought out . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:01 pm <p> ps <p> Right the ship ? I suggest he start looking for a life ring before he 's in over his head . Of course , he was figuratively in over his head from the start . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:01 pm <p> Jerry , Florida <p> Hmmm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former tax returns . 2 . Move back into that basement apartment . 3 . Tell the truth about Bain 's outsourcing agenda . and finally . . . wear a pair of flip flops during his travels . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:02 pm <p> Christine C. Curtis <p> Mr. Cafferty ... why does n't anyone , anywhere talk about his grand-daddy who escaped to Mexico because he was hounded out of the US for his Morman polygymous beliefs ? Rommney just said that he would be better off being a Latino , what was that ? Look up his grandfather and why his dad , George was in Mexico as a child . If we are such a liberal , elite media , why is this not getting attention ? Just saying ... <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:02 pm <p> Jeff C. <p> Right the ship ? I think he just scuttled his ship leaving Republican " Freeloaders " confused about who to vote for . His only chance is to say what he really believes and specifically what he plans for the country instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:02 pm <p> Patrick <p> Jack , <p> I frankly see little if any chance Romney can get back on track with enough time left to overcome President Obama 's lead . At this point the debates are his only real remaining chance to seize the initiative , and given how easily he 's shown himself to be flustered ( especially compared to Obama 's legendary ability to keep cool and collected ) , that strikes me as exceedingly unlikely to occur . Similarly , at this point he has only one plausible pathway to electoral victory , winning Ohio , Florida , and Virginia . If he loses even one , he 's toast and Obama 's leading him in all three . <p> Finally , with as little time left as there is in the campaign , I have a hard time seeing how he can shake his personal unlikeability problem , even if he can go one week without either sneering at dead American diplomats or reveal his callous disdain for anyone who does n't own a minimum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to cover for his deeply insulting " 47% of Americans can get stuffed for all I care " remarks is to dredge up a pretty benign comment by Obama and try to desperately red-bait with it . Not only is it a million miles from any sort of actual socialism , Obama said it fourteen years ago ; you know , back when Romney was campaigning for universal health care . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:02 pm <p> Tom Morris <p> Perhaps the DNC could counter Governor Romney recent web ad with " Romney Revealed . " Perhaps like 41 , he was born with a silver foot in his mouth . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:03 pm <p> Gurgyl <p> Coalition ruin the nation-3 or4 ot 5 party . Ex : India . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:03 pm <p> Skylarro Heynow <p> In all honesty , all Mitt Romney needs to do is. 1 ) . Hold a press conference and apologize to the American Public , clearly stating that he was wrong to make that statement . 2 ) Dip himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 19 , 2012 at 5:05 pm <p> Joe - New York , New York <p> Jack , I 'm afraid there is nothing Romney can do . His pandering to the crazy Republican base has doomed him from the start . Any changes to his positions will only further brand him as a flip flopper . He has no soul and no game . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:05 pm <p> Linda in Arizona <p> Jump over the side ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:06 pm <p> Nick Thompson <p> I disagree that this was a gaffe . A gaffe is an unintentional act or remark . Mr. Romney did n't unintentionally write off 47% of the American people as freeloaders , it was the point of his argument . An argument he has repeated in his press conference and his OP-Ed in the USA Today . His argument is flawed , definitely , but it is an argument he meant to make . <p> As for writing the ship , he would need to apologize , something he has vowed not to do and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He needs to make sure people think they were n't in the 47% he insulted , and forget everyone they know who is . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:06 pm <p> GI Joe <p> He ca n't . Too many blatant lies from Ryan/Romney in the age of computers and people being able to do their own research instead of following those lies has put an end to Ryan/romney . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:06 pm <p> Stephen Herzog <p> First of all , Romney 's statement was not a gaffe . It was a rare glimpse of candor in an otherwise make believe campaign . Second , he does n't have to do anything . His base , who he needs most desparately , was energized by Mitt actually saying something with conviction . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:07 pm <p> Rick , San Diego <p> Jack , for Romney to right this dingy , he has to look himself in the mirror and be honest with himself , something he probably has never done since at least 1994 . <p> September 19 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to help the starving than to continue to subsidize the Oil companies . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:07 pm <p> Larry from St. Joe , Mo . <p> " Right the Ship " ?

Stop being all things to all people and let the chips fall where they may . When voters ca n't be sure what a candidate 's real point of view is -- it 's a problem . Sign me a worried Republican from Sioux City IA . <p> If Romney were speaking on behalf of the Republic he would have said : My party has constituents that abuse this country too , the highest levels of welfare reside in red states . Many of my business partners find anyway possible to not pay taxes and this is a problem that is shared across both parties . We need a plan to increase revenues and get people back to work like restricting business in other country 's . It 's time for America to stop aid and subsidies and focus on the most important of our interests ... Our people . <p> Then the donors would have gotten up and left without donating a dime . <p> September 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you did nt pay federal taxes you are a no good lazy bum . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:09 pm <p> militarymike <p> He might be able to right the ship , but it 's stuck on the ocean floor forever . <p> At this point he needs to buy a new yacht ... and see if that one floats . Mr. 13% 's certainly got the disposable income for it . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:12 pm <p> Michael in Stony Brook <p> He could start by giving some real specifics about what loop holes he will close . Saying " Well , the specifics are these which is those principles I described are the heart of my policy " does n't count . Of course if he actually says what loop holes he will close he will cease to be a viable candidate because the only loop holes he can close are almost universally popular . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:13 pm <p> Lois Carrig <p> I ca n't even believe the Republicans picked Romney to represent them . This man born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the wealthy can afford , like entering a horse in the Olympics , has no clue what iit s like for the majority of us to live . His ludicrous remarks when in Israel also shows that he is simply not the man we need to handle foreign policy in these troubled times . In my opinion he would be a poor choice to handle the domestic or foreign affairs of the United States . Erie , PA <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:14 pm <p> Daniel from Chicago <p> To right the ship Romney would have to show that he is genuine . Americans largely have the perception that Mitt Romney is the typical politician who is only in it for himself and will say or do anything to win the election . I may not support him , but I still think he is a better man that his campaigning makes him seem . Going back to his roots as the moderate Republican who who he used to be ( the same one who came up with the idea of Obamacare ) will help him win this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bart in Omaha <p> As CEO of his campaign , he has done a terrible job . I believe this is a window into what his presidency would look like . After the multitude of stumbles ( corporations are people , not caring about the really poor , insulting England during the Olympics while in England , the $10K bet , etc. ) , the flip-flopping on every major issue and mismanagement by his staff , what can he do now to show that he is competent ? I do n't think anything -- but he had better do extremely well in the debates and hope for a major blunder by Obama . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:14 pm <p> Bernie of Lowell , MA <p> Mitt Romney 's ship has been lost for many years as he 's attempted to navigate life without ful participation from either of his parents . Like George W. Bush , he was farmed out to nursemaids , private school masters and later , college professors who could not give him the proper life navigation tools . Instead , he sought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bully on account of his insecurity . As an adult , like George W. , he 's still looking for a " father image " in the fog , without a beacon to guide him .. <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:15 pm <p> PixieDust <p> Whether the Republicans like it or not they are hitched to Romney 's ship for the duration . It would be unprecedented for him to step aside . The captain was not qualified nor the ship loaded improperly . It 's not possible to right it under way . Romney seems unable to run a credible campaign so why should we trust him to run the country ? <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:15 pm <p> NanH <p> Stop worring about righting the boat and start counting the life vests <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:17 pm <p> Joseph <p> Jack -- Are you kidding me ? The ship is heading in the right direction , the real question is how do you get a few key states to educate them on the disasterly path Obama is about to take this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign of lies , and disception from the Obama camp . What makes is worse , the media ( ie : CNN ) are so bias for Obama , that no on is getting the larger picture . Go see OBAMA 2016 -- Ohio , Michigan , Florida , Colorado , Nevada , and Wisconsin wake up . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:17 pm <p> Douglas Post <p> He could start by apologizing to the 47 percent , Latinos , the Palestinians , the English , the Russians and everyone else he 's offended . Oh , wait . This is The " No Apology " Tour . I guess being Mitt means never having to say you 're sorry . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:18 pm <p> Susan from Ca <p> The ship is sunk , he needs to start paddling his canoe up the preverbal creek . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:18 pm <p> Charles Hawkins <p> Romney is done . If President Obama called 47% called ' victimns ' and moochers , we would be in impeachment hearing now , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romney only wants to show off to his wealthy buddies he for CEO of America , he does n't care for America . <p> Charles from California <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:19 pm <p> Big Bob <p> And yet , in spite of all of the children 's ravings , Obama ( remember him ? The President ? ) has lost his convention bounce and the polls are even yet again . Jack , really . Do you think seniors and the military will vote for the president ? I think not . <p> Noonan was right , but " No Apology " Romney wo n't heed her advice ... and the last time I looked , Jack , you ca n't right a sinking ship . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:20 pm <p> Jon from Tempe , Az <p> To right the ship he needs to jump off the ship and let Obama captain the ship . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:20 pm <p> Tania <p> I grew up in the Midwest , and I have a hard time understanding how citizens of smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some money from larger states to smaller states has been very beneficial for my home state and has been necessary for important programs . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:20 pm <p> Daryl Logan <p> The ship already sank .... He should forfeit this election and save us all time and money . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:20 pm <p> Em , Yukon <p> I think he should change his campaign slogan to " Here Comes Romney Boo Boo " . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:20 pm <p> michael <p> Right the ship ..... are you kidding ... he 's on the Titanic ! ! ! !

That should even the keel . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:21 pm <p> lindaab <p> Romney needs a big big crane - kind of like what it will take to " right " the sinking cruise ship off the Italian coast . Unfortunately , there is no such crane in the Republican party ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:21 pm <p> Karthik <p> A president needs to be trusted .

For the first time I agree with Peggy Noonan ... " this is n't working . " Certainly the GOP has another more competent Captain out there . Perhaps not . Romney is incompetent at best . And by the way , why has n't he created any jobs nationally in the past 3.5 years . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:21 pm <p> Shawn Spence <p> What does Mitt Romney have to do to right the ship ? He could come a little more to the left for starters . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:21 pm <p> Ryan Martin <p> This is going to be a rough week for Mitt Romney ... last week was a rough week for Mitt Romney . What is the difference between your ordinary gaft that the media sensationalizes and these new candid videos just released by " Mother Jones ? His responses on a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-of-touch Oligarchist , who just does n't care about the average guy . " <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:21 pm <p> Jean in Houston <p> I think the only hope for candidate Mitt Romney now is to get a brain transplant . Wait , make that a heart transplant . Wait again - make that both ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:22 pm <p> Bob <p> Mitt and his party are promulgating and arguing against their own manufactured political mythology . They are in the business of courting votes based on political nonsense . Examples include : The President is a socialist , a foreign national , a Muslim . In addition , their cavalcade includes allegories like we live in an American welfare state , death panels , lazy poor , war on Christmas , class warfare . Trying to garner votes from the citizens who believe in these easily identified figments is a politically self nullifying endeavor . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:22 pm <p> Steve , Clifton , Virginia <p> Romney should go back to what he was successful at and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly appointed campaign staff . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:22 pm <p> SG <p> Sorry , but it 's too , too late ; the ship 's sunk . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:22 pm <p> Susan - Laguna Hills <p> Chop off all his toes so they wo n't stuck in his mouth again , or go back to school and learn how to be a more caring person for the well being of the nation . <p> Susan -- Laguna HIlls <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:22 pm <p> Warren in Minnesota <p> Perhaps he needs to wait ANOTHER 4 years and try it again . That would be , let 's see , 10 years of trying to be the president . Perhaps he needs a little more seasoning . Oh , what 's that ? ... you ca n't take the stripes off a zebra ? Never mind then .... <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:22 pm <p> Keith <p> Step down , and let Ryan run at the top of the ticket .

He 's the reason for the teetering . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:22 pm <p> Martha Brooks <p> Nothing he can do now ... whilst shooting himself in the foot , the bullet also put a sizable hole in the ship 's bottom . It 's taking on water , and he and boat are sinking fast . Martha , Rew , PA <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:22 pm <p> r.landschoot <p> Media has assisnated Romney 's canadancy , but he keeps furnishing bullets for their guns . MSNBC WINS ! ! ! ! !

Trouble is , there is no such crane in the Republican party ! <p> Linda B -- Santa Cruz , CA <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:23 pm <p> Stewart <p> Nothing Jack . His ship has sunk .. <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:23 pm <p> Kurt S <p> It 's no longer possible with the current republican party . He must move toward the center but would lose the base but if he keeps the base he loses the center . Obama kept moving right and the right kept moving away to oppose him till they held ideals that do n't work on a national level . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:23 pm <p> Drew <p> It 's a little too late .

Now we 're talking about handouts and entitlement . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:23 pm <p> Claudia , Houston , Tx <p> Romney needs a secret weapon and that secret weapon could be to release 10 years of his tax returns , that is if those returns do n't sink his ship . <p> Details , details and details , thats what he needs to give . The rhetoric can change only so many people and repeating the same thing will not have any effect . Give more details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- details for why trickle down never works : <p> Let us say you are a business owner . Unlce sam gives you money in Tax breaks . You have some extra money now . Will you hire someone or increase pay scales ? you will only do this when it is " necessary " . This " Necessity " comes from " incentive " . This " incentive " comes from " demand " and this " demand " is direct indicator of " sales " . These " sales " are created by Middle class and not the rich ( Unless you are talking about high end brands , which are and also create few jobs ) . Hence there will NEVER be a trickle . <p> See details convince people <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:24 pm <p> OldSeaDog <p> Loose lips sink ships . That pretty much sums Mitt Romney 's campaign . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:24 pm <p> Jason <p> Right the ship ? ! Are you kidding ? ! Romney is only still campaigning to save face for the party -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face he also shows his ass . If he was a real man , he would throw the towel in and let a real Republican represent the party -- unfortunate he won the primary . Ron Paul probably would have been competitive .... <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:24 pm <p> David Doherty <p> Get off the ship , and do n't forget your life vest David from NH . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:24 pm <p> Jacques Lalonde <p> The Best thing Mitt Romney can do to right the ship is VOTE FOR OBAMA ! ! ! Then he could instruct the Republicans to stop working to defeat the Democrats and start working to MAKE LIFE BETTER ALL AMERICANS . Work to make Obamacare better ... work to CREATE JOBS .... work together to avert the Fiscal Clff ..... it 's a bigger ship than one small election . <p> J.Lalonde , Vancouver Canada <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:24 pm <p> Lacey in Southern CA <p> Maybe Mitt Romney should graciously donate 47% of his income to us Obama supporters . Now we 're talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 5:24 pm <p> Pete , NJ <p> First , Romney needs to find a seaworthy ship to right . His is so full of holes from the flip-flop in policy , no one knows what the campaign believes . Second , he needs to stop punching new holes in his ship . He can not right the ship of state with ineptitude . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:24 pm <p> Big Bob <p> Polls are still even ... <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:24 pm <p> Joseph <p> GO SEE OBAMA 2016 -- The USA as we use to know it is being distroyed by Obama . For those that are definding Obama -- I really think you need to educate yourself , and learn what this loser of a president is doing to this country . Rome will fall , Obama is making it easy ... <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:24 pm <p> Countess Faye <p> Hire a voodoo priestess , i know one thats looking for work **32;2809;TOOLONG <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:25 pm <p> Charles in Alabama <p> Ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5:25 pm <p> mazen <p> romey and his rich clans should take the rest of campain money and hide it in the cayman island before people finds out who the real mooch is .. he 's not gon na win and he knows it <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:25 pm <p> Joe Rizo <p> Romney 's campaign is like the Titanic , we all know what happened to that ship . <p> Mitt Romney 's claim to the Presidency is that he can do better on the economy than Barack Obama . He has to get specific ... showing us his management skills , insights , and plans ... so that we can believe in that narrative . Otherwise , we 're stuck with his campaign , which looks more like a badly run flea market than a smooth-running corporate enterprise . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:25 pm <p> GaryB <p> I figure that Mitt has about two weeks to make some sort of progress in the polls ( Rasmussen probably should n't count , as their Likely Voter criteria tends to skew Republican ) . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senate and house candidates in close races will start distancing themselves from Romney for fear of being dragged down with him during the last month of campaigning . Once Mitt 's own party accelerates their adandonment of him , it seems unlikely that enough independents will break his way to swing the election . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:25 pm <p> PAUL <p> The question that I have Jack is , " does Governor Romney wants to become POTUS ? " I do n't get a sense or a warm fuzzy feeling that he does , I 'm a non voter by the way . But , I think he actually believes that this is how life is in his world . I think he sees the presidency like that golden toy , the one you always wanted , but got a fixer upper or a hand-me-down , but never that golden toy , so you decide you want to buy it . After you bought it and had it for a short while , you realize that , this is it ? Whats all the fuss about ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what i thought it was . So now he wants to return it . He is sabotaging his own ship Jack . And he wants to take the entire country along with him ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:25 pm <p> Gigi Oregon <p> Mitt reminds me of the Captain , Francesco Schettino of the Costa Concordia . Romney wants to put his hands on the helm of our country but he 's in the private dinner room laughing with the elites , at a 50 thousand dollar dinner fund raiser . Belittling half of the country . Forgetting his responsibility to the rest of " We the People " . Now the rest of the Captain 's story ; While the ship sinks , people die , because of the Captains folly . Even though the ship is salvaged the party is over . <p> Mitt Romney 's words will ring in my ears long past election day and I am not , amused . Nor do I believe are those who suffer under such arrogance . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:25 pm <p> richard a. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This guy is a genuine horse 's ass . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:25 pm <p> Wayne <p> Mr. Romney needs to put a white flag and get prepared for a burial at sea ... <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:26 pm <p> ed in florida <p> I make 9 bucks an hour Mitt and working my tail off for it and they take taxes from my check each week . The fact is i was making more money than this in 1983 . Maybe if the corporations worried more about their employee 's and paid them a living wage they would make enough money to pay taxes . You make more money in a day off your overseas investments than ill make in a year . Yet you have the nerve to call americans lazy and feeling deserving of entitlements . Mr Romney you can never wright the ship because your words have shown the so called 47 percent and the rest of the country where your thoughts are and loyalties lie . You should leave this country and I suggest you go where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 5:26 pm <p> Kay <p> He could try and live like the rest of us for a month while the camera followed him , no healthcare , no job , only a few dollars of food stamps , so we make sure he does n't lie.But that 's not gon na happen.Then we will see if the boat sinks . <p> If Mitt Romney ever wants to be President of this United States , he needs to go back to class , take some social studies classes , in order to really know what the middle class is going through , and then do some community organizing , in order to identify with it literally . Mitt being a business man may well qualify you as a finance secretary , but DEFINITELY not the Zpresident if the United States , who is the VICTIM now Mitt ? Lol <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:26 pm <p> Dennis from Utah <p> It 's too late to make any nuanced , graceful corrections , but any sudden course changes would scare off even his strongest supporters . <p> It would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:26 pm <p> Arch Stanton <p> I sure hope not . The way a candidate runs his campaign is a picture of the way he 'd run the office if he won it ... and America 's too great of a country to have such an incompetent fumbler at the wheel . Right now all Romney 's incompetence is doing is wrecking his own campaign . If he were president , our fate would be tied to his , and that would be a nightmare . <p> 1 . Release his taxes . 2 . Give specifics how is going to make things better , not just say " trust me. " 3 . Stop saying what Obama has n't done-Republican obstructionists stopped every effort he made-and start talking about what he is going to do-goes back to 2 . What is he going to do ? 4 . Try a positive approach instead of negativity and telling lies <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:27 pm <p> s22 <p> maybe he could right the ship if her were latino . <p> September 19 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to do a thing , and continue to spread the truth about Pres. Obama to the 47% . Oh , I 'm a retired private sector union official on SS and private retirement and an agent orange disabled Vietnam veteran who have experienced so many who attempt to take advantage of the Federal Government . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:27 pm <p> carrie in Birmingham <p> Right the ship ? How about he just get off and let a better captain lead . In this case Capt Obama might not have started out as the most experienced captain but he has become a most impressive one . He seems much more trustwotrhy than the Romney crew to lead us forward out of troubled waters . Rommey is use to a yacht , not a battleship . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:27 pm <p> Karthik <p> Romney is a really nice and very qualified president . The problem -- Catering to Tea party . Picking a lying Ryan was a BIG mistake . Disowning his Health Care Reform for MA is another and the list goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Governor of MA <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:27 pm <p> D <p> Jack , How again is Mitt wrong ? What 's there to right ? If America cant stand the blunt honest truth about what our society has begum , then there is no hope of a greater tomorow ! Sometimes people just need the hard honest truth about what is really going on ! Thanks Mitt !

Let it sink . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:28 pm <p> Richs <p> Fortunately for Mr. Romney not as many people follow the news as you think . If he can win the debates , and demonize Obama like Obama 's campaign has done to him it will be a close race . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:28 pm <p> Wayne <p> Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for a burial at sea ... <p> I think Mr. Romney needs to speak from the heart instead of trying to follow the party line . I do n't really care about his tax returns . He probably has n't done anything that every sitting politician is n't currently doing to shelter income . Mr. Romney needs to stress why he is running in the first place -- unlike most politicians it is n't to get wealthy because he 's already there . Shame that Dennis Miller did n't speak at the GOP Convention and tell it like it is : the safety net is meant for the helpless , not the clueless . The problem is that the clueless still have the right to vote . They sure know their rights -- shame they do n't live up to their responsibilities , and it 's too bad every American must first pass a civics course before they are given the right to vote ... Do they even teach civics in elementary school anymore ? Just might be part of the problem ... <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't " right the ship " , because he ca n't change who he is . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:29 pm <p> whtswithinhim <p> To right the ship ... you must control the ship ... with do as I do and not as I say ... show his success with taxes with the release of his taxes , and all can believe that this ship is under control ! ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:29 pm <p> Mike Tucci <p> You just ca n't hide who you REALLY are and who Mr. Romney really is we do NOT need in this country right now . <p> Well , Mitt Romney is n't a good enough communicator ( Reagan , in his day or more recently the brilliant communicator Bill Clinton ) as examples , or a good enough actor to be other than who he is . He is a wealthy man who is n't cut out for the job he 's trying for . You ca n't be something you 're not and get away with it unless truly deceitful and/or gifted .

We are not asking for anything more from the government than we were promised and worked hard for the past 50 years . The only way Romney can straighten the ship is to surrender it to a man with 4 years experience , who believes he is the President of all the people . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:30 pm <p> Roni Morgan <p> Jack I 'm not even an US citizen I 'm from Europe but I really have been wondering . With a broken economy depending on foreign oil , not to mention the made in China fact and wars around the globe ?

Are we talking about the presidency or the next US battle ship captain ? In both cases he would lose . Jack I think it 's clear and with all greatest respects Mitt Romney is qualified for 3rd place . Not good enough to run any ship but his own . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:30 pm <p> EZ from Tennessee <p> Mr. Romney should retro-actively not run for president . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:30 pm <p> Dave P. <p> Dave in Ottawa , Canada <p> Romney is steering his campaign with all the skill and professionalism as the captain of the Costa Concordia ... <p> Best he should just not say anything .... ever ... again ....

In fact , he needs to toss overboard the life preservers and untie the lifeboats , so that no one ( who finally comes to their senses ) on his campaign can save themselves . That is the only way he is not going to end up alone and on his own when the ship goes completely under . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:34 pm <p> Nelson Smith <p> It 's extremely curious that he has disparaged 47% of the population based , in part , on whether they paid any income tax , when many of them have paid their taxes all along in their paychecks and then may have received a refund for overpayment . In contrast , by refusing to release his tax returns , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes all along . Would n't it be ironic if his tax returns show he himself falls into the same 47% category by not paying any taxes at all during those years . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:35 pm <p> John McCormick <p> Essentially he said " LET THEM EAT CAKE " I hear this comparison from Republicans .. so ; Mitt is Marie Antoinette ? <p> John McCormick Charleston , SC <p> ( Disabled Vet -- 47%-er -- Govt Teat-Suckler <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:35 pm <p> Peggy <p> I think it is over for Willard .

Up periscope <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:44 pm <p> Tony Hamelin <p> Romney is showing his true colors . He has no concept of what working and poor people do to contribute to society , beyond making him and his ilk even richer .

No solutions , no optimism . The right has simply been led to believe that Obama is the worst person in the world and they can not understand why their perception of the man is seemingly so different than that of the rest of the country -- most pointedly the mainstream media . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:49 pm <p> JLawson <p> The use of " a newly surfaced 1998 clip " by a then Senator Obama only shows the desperation of a failing campaign by Romney to take attention off of his statement about the " 47% of the people " that he implied were the leaches of our society . It wo n't work , we know what Romney thinks and always did , at least it was good to hear him tell the truth for once about what he really thinks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stark example of who is talking class warfare ! As for redistribution of wealth , when did this become a " bad " word ? Redistribution has always been a part of what this country and our government has been about using our taxes to support public education and student loans , federal dollars for healthcare clinics , to non profit and for profit hospitals , government funded research , small business loans , farm aid , FEMA and natural disasters , federally insured banks ( to insure we do n't lose our money if a bank fails ) , and all of the federal assistance that all of our state congressional representatives back and request yearly , ALL is redistribution of wealth , the wealth of the country ! <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:49 pm <p> Nelson Smith <p> If this were a first round job interview where he was going to manage people and he made comments like that , he would not make the short list .

He needs to tell the people what his plans to better the economy and all the other issues such as foreign policy . He needs to release his tax returns just like other release theirs for five or more years . He needs to consider all people of all gender and race who lives in America as Americans and not just his family , friends and wealthy businessmen . However , he had years to get himself in a position to win this election and he is lagging behind so that tells me he is not the leader that he says he is especially if you left BAIN in 1999 and allow your signature to be used within the company til 2002 .

I do n't understand the fuss and why people are so shocked and surprised . Those statements are what Romney is and believes ( despite what I think qualifies as a " pot , meet kettle " moment -- Mitt , millionaires , billionaires , and corporations , then , are by his own definition , moochers and leeches because they 're not paying taxes either , and corporations are getting gov't subsidies as well ) . <p> I 've always thought Romney only thinks you matter if you 're a millionaire or a billionaire , or a wealthy corporation . Most people in MA already know this . These statements are n't gaffes ; what he should have said was " I spoke from the heart " rather than it was " inelegantly stated " . <p> And yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard and still needs help . Retirees , military folks , disabled folks , students , those in low-paying jobs .

To the rest of us , he ca n't right his ship . The Titanic is taking on water and going down , and the captain should go down with the ship . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:53 pm <p> Semper Cogitatus <p> " Right the ship " ? That 's silly .

In fact , while the candor he expressed is n't the normal repetitive talking points we normally hear from politicians afraid to lose votes , Romney 's comments were actually tremendously refreshing . Besides , his concerns are those that most Republican voters have been feeling for years . While it may be hard to hear , there comes a point where we simply need to ask , should we be a country where the majority of people do n't pay income taxes but control fiscal policy through thier majority at the ballot box ? Or do we want a country where the majority of people work , pay taxes and therefore , have a stake ? The later option is what made America what it is today and what we are in danger of losing : The strongest and most free economic and military power the world has ever known . <p> September 19 , 2012 at 5:55 pm <p> Nathan Danielnson <p> I must start by pointing out that I am rather new to the political seen .

In following this presidential election I have found that the Republican party has been fighting this campaign like a war . By crusading around flaws they found in policies of the presidency they pulled their party together based on the idea that the Democratic plan for the country will not work . Regardless as to whether they are right the fact is that the party has been embolden already . What his campaign needs now is to cool down and take a more measured moderate pace to reach out to moderate america that is waiting to decide what is the right coarse for america . I believe that both candidates truly believe that there plan will work . I believe that both candidates want what is best for this country . I believe That both plans have merit .

The more of the video you watch , the more you realize how much contempt Romney has for the " lower class " . According to him , middle class is any family making between $200k and 250k . So all of us dirtbags that make under $200k are government mooches , and Romney wants nothing to do with us ? At least he 's honest . <p> I love how he talks about China 's working conditions , and says being born in the US is like being born with a silver spoon . Well , Mitt , our factories would be just like China 's if it were n't for labor unions . You know , the entities that you blame for the downfall of our economy ? <p> I am voting for Obama , AND I pay taxes , Payroll taxes , federal taxes , state taxes .

##402552 <h> Marius <p> Marius is the narrator and an important character of the Diablo II cutscenes . In the first cinematic , Marius is found inside an asylum where he is visited by a mysterious figure . Marius , recognizing the figure as the Archangel Tyrael , apologizes and tells him " it was not his fault " . Upon hearing this , the presumed Archangel asks Marius what exactly he meant by that , prompting Marius to tell his story . <p> Marius lived in the Rogue Monastery until Diablo ' s hellspawn overwhelmed the citadel . He fled , finding refuge in a small hostel along with other outcasts and fighting nightmares of the attack . But Diablo , in the guise of the Dark Wanderer , stopped at the same hostel , and the place was quickly destroyed by the demons that his presence called up . Being the only survivor , Marius was compelled to follow the Dark Wanderer , and chronicled the journey from the forests of Westmarch to the gates of the Burning Hells . <p> Marius did not know that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the deserts of Aranoch . The night they reached the outskirts of Lut Gholein and made camp , the Wanderer inspired in him a dream of Baal ' s capture and imprisonment in his Soulstone . Against his better judgment , Marius followed the Dark Wanderer into Tal Rasha ' s tomb . He sensed the changes in the Wanderer as Diablo 's spirit gained control . Reaching Tal Rasha 's Chamber , Diablo rushed forward to release Baal but was intercepted by the Archangel Tyrael . As the demon and angel fought , Tal Rasha 's crazed spirit pleaded with Marius to release him . Marius pulled Baal 's Soulstone that contained the demon 's essence from Tal Rasha 's ribcage , releasing Baal from his prison . Tyrael charged Marius with going to the Burning Hells and destroying Baal 's soulstone at the Hellforge ; he ran out of the tomb as Baal joined the battle against Tyrael . <p> Following Tyrael 's instructions , Marius travelled to Kurast and finds the Three Prime Evils gathered in the depths of the Temple of Zakarum , together summoning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanderer completed his transformation into Diablo ' s physical manifestation , and passed through the gate into Hell . <p> Marius could not bring himself to enter the portal into hell ; completely horrified and utterly confused at the horrors that he had seen , he ended up in an insane asylum . Tortured by the malefic power of the soulstone , Marius ' appearance changed - he now looked like an old man , though he was only of middle age . Still he had hung onto the soulstone . <p> At this point Marius bursts into tears , asking the Archangel for his forgiveness : he could not bear to enter the gate and destroy the stone . After listening to his story , the figure persuades Marius to hand him the soulstone , reassuring Marius that " all shall be forgiven " . After Marius hands the mysterious figure the soulstone , he reveals his true identity - not the Archangel Tyrael , but the last living Prime Evil , Baal . Baal then proceeds to murder Marius and departs as flames consume the asylum . <p> Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only once referred to by Deckard Cain in the expansion where he is already dead - he is a vital character , fueling the story through his actions . <p> " Tyrael ...

We climbed the last bridge . There , below us , lay our destination . The shining jewel , Lut Gholein , with the Great Sea beyond . " <p> " We made camp there last night . Perhaps it was the warm desert wind or the sound of the ocean , but for the first time in many weeks ... I slept . However , the dreams returned , but these were clearly not my own .

Manning <p> " I think that the great thing about the business is that we 're all just trying to tell stories in different ways , " actor/producer Mike C. Manning tells me during a recent phone chat . " Hopefully I get better and better and get bigger projects , so that one day I 'm able to write and produce and act in my own stories , and more able to tell the stories I want to tell the way that I want to tell them . " <p> He 's calling just after his latest film , I Do , premiered at Hollywood 's Ford Theater . He plays the role of Craig in a cast that includes Jamie-Lynn Sigler ( The Sopranos ) and Alicia Witt ( Law &; Order : Criminal Intent ) . " It 's getting great reviews , " he says of the flick . " It examines different relationships and it has a very political undertone to it . " ( The official website calls it " a film about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . " ) <p> This year has been a busy one for Mike . He also appeared in Black Hearts and the Hallmark Channel telefilm Operation Cupcake , which was a highlight for more personal reasons . " It 's with Dean Cain and Kristy Swanson - two of my childhood heroes , Superman and Buffy , " he explained . <p> Between the three flicks , he is already establishing a range of roles , be it a gay man in I Do or the " All-American " type in Operation Cupcake . <p> Whoever he 's playing , one thing he 's always looking for with each part that comes his way is significance beyond just entertainment . " I 'm lucky enough to start to be able to pick certain roles and really pursue being a part of certain projects that I think are meaningful to me , " he says . " I try to be involved with roles that kind of speak to me . " <p> Beyond that , anything is possible . " You 're always looking for something that you have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eye on one genre in particular . " If a sci-fi role came to me right now , or a superhero role , I would jump on it because that sounds like a lot of fun , " he told me . " I love action . I 'm the type of guy who , with The Avengers , I went to a midnight showing with my Iron Man T-shirt on and I was screaming the whole time . " <p> An actor since he was fourteen , Mike says that his interest in acting began when he started doing theater . " I just fell in love with the idea of becoming a different character . The entire idea of acting is that you get to kind of absorb and live in the life of somebody else . It was really fun to kind of step out of my everyday life . " <p> In addition to acting , Mike has ventured into producing with the documentary Kidnapped for Christ , which is in post-production . He describes it as " a project shedding light on institutional abuse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of MTV 's The Real World : Washington D.C. in 2009-2010 . <p> The significance Mike looks for in his acting roles is the same thing he strives for in his personal life . He is passionate about extending his goals beyond career success , as an outspoken activist for numerous causes . He 's working on a book , and has given speeches at over three dozen schools on topics that he 's passionate about . Of his charity work , he says , " I 've been fortunate enough to be involved with many non-profit organizations , particularly ones that fight for equal rights . My heart will fall in love with a certain non-profit and I 'll get more involved than maybe the average person might . <p> " Back in February , a group of friends and I threw a fundraiser for a homeless youth program at the L.A. Gay and Lesbian Center , and ended up raising over $300,000 for the program , which was just incredible . To have it go so well and see the direct impact that it has on a population that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrated his positive off-camera message into his career as well . " I produced a TV show a couple of months ago called The Passion Project , a pilot which had kind of a feel-good message about being able to make a change in the world , " he continues . " It 's definitely helped me realize that I 'm just one piece in the puzzle and as much as we actors like to think it 's all about us , it 's not all about us . " <p> No matter what the future holds for Mike as an actor , he 's already making an impact in the world at large , with a half-dozen organizations he 's worked with or currently supports . One gets the sense that is more gratifying for him than any acting accolade he could earn , and that 's admirable . For all the stories he 's trying to tell , Mike is doing an excellent job writing his own

##427950 <h> Tags : <p> Before presenting a critique of traditional just war theory ( which I call the " Theory , " for short ) I should make two points of clarification . Although the Theory is largely congruent with the international law of war , the subject of just war theory is not law but morality . If the inconsistencies and absurdities I will describe were confined to the law , they would be less troubling . Because the law is an artifact and does not purport to state truths about a reality that is independent of human invention , it can tolerate considerable disunity . But just war theory is usually understood as a set of principles that have been discovered rather than designed , and that provide an objective account of the morality of war . If just war theory is more than just a set of conventions , and if the objections I will advance here are correct , the traditional version of just war theory must be rejected . <p> Second , the term " war " is ambiguous . There is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of war by all the parties to a conflict . World War II was a war in this sense . But " war " can also refer to the belligerent action of only one side -- -- for example , the war that Britain fought against Germany , which was a part of World War II . My remarks will generally be concerned with wars in the second sense , for only such wars can be just or unjust . Thus , while Britain 's war against Germany was just , World War II was neither just nor unjust . <p> Permissible Acts , Unjust War ? <p> I turn now to the critique of the Theory . As I noted earlier , just war theory distinguishes between the principles of jus ad bellum ( resort to war ) and those of jus in bello ( conduct in war ) . According to the Theory , the latter are independent of the former , in the sense that what it is permissible for a combatant to do in war is unaffected by whether his war is just or unjust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just war ( " just combatants " ) are also permissible for those ( " unjust combatants " ) who fight for aims that are unjust . Combatants on both sides have the same rights , permissions and liabilities -- a view commonly known as the " moral equality of combatants . " According to this view , if we accept that it is permissible for just combatants to participate in warfare , we must also accept that the same is true of unjust combatants . Both just combatants and unjust combatants act impermissibly only if they violate the rules of jus in bello -- that is , only if they fight in an impermissible manner . This has one immediately paradoxical implication : namely , that if unjust combatants fight without violating the rules governing the conduct of war , all their individual acts of war are permissible ; yet these individual acts together constitute a war that is unjust and therefore impermissible . But how can a series of individually permissible acts be collectively impermissible ? <p> Leif Parsons <p> To resolve this paradox , the Theory has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the state , or the government that represents it . Hence only the members of the government responsible for decisions about the resort to war act impermissibly when a state fights an unjust war . Suppose , for example , that the armies of Aggressia have unjustly invaded and conquered neighboring Benignia . Aggressian soldiers never once violated the principles of jus in bello . But to defeat the Benignian army , it was necessary for them to kill more than a million Benignian soldiers , most of whom were civilians when the invasion began and enlisted in the military only to defend their country from Aggressia . According to the Theory , the only people who have done anything wrong in bringing about this vast slaughter are a handful of Aggressian political leaders who spent the war in their offices and never killed anyone . <p> This is incompatible with what we believe about killing in other contexts . Normally , the perpetrator of an act of killing is responsible for the victim 's death to at least as high a degree as an accessory who may have paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds that in an unjust war fought in accordance with the principles of jus in bello , only the accessories who have instigated the killing ( the political leaders ) are responsible for it and have therefore done wrong , while the perpetrators ( the unjust combatants ) bear no responsibility and have done no wrong . But how can unjust combatants act permissibly when , as the Theory concedes , their ends are unjust , their means include the intentional killing of people who have done no wrong , and their action also kills innocent bystanders as a side effect ? They may , of course , be excused -- that is , they may not be culpable -- if they mistakenly though blamelessly believe that their war is just , or if they fight under irresistible duress . But that is quite different from acting permissibly in the objective sense , which is what the Theory claims they do . <p> The Theory 's assurance that unjust combatants do no wrong provided they follow the rules makes it easier for governments to initiate unjust wars . The Theory can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight in an unjust war , no matter how criminal . If a young German in 1939 had consulted the Theory for guidance about whether to join the Wehrmacht , it would have told him that it was permissible to participate in Nazi aggression provided that he obeyed the principles of jus in bello ( for example , by refraining from intentionally attacking civilians ) . To the extent that the theory has shaped our ways of thinking about the morality of war , it has enabled soldiers to believe that it is permissible to kill people who are merely trying to defend themselves and others from unjust aggression , provided the victims are wearing uniforms and the killing is done under orders from appropriate authorities . <p> The Morality of Self-Defense <p> Traditional theorists seek to justify their extraordinary claim -- that those who fight and kill in an unjust war never do wrong provided they kill in accordance with the rules -- by appealing to the familiar idea that , while it is not permissible to attack people who are innocent , it can be permissible to attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses these words in a special way . Innocent means " unthreatening , " so that in war non-combatants are innocent while all combatants are noninnocent . Thus , in Walzer 's words , the right not to be attacked " is lost by those who bear arms ... because they pose a danger to other people . " This is true of the just and the unjust alike . " Simply by fighting , " Walzer claims , they lose " their title to life ... even though , unlike aggressor states , they have committed no crime . " According to this view , all violent action that is defensive is self-justifying , assuming it is also necessary and proportionate . <p> This account of defensive rights accords no significance to the distinction between wrongful aggressors and their victims , or between unjust and just combatants . Each has a right of defense against the other . Such a view has no plausibility outside the context of war . If a police officer , for example , is about to shoot a murderer on a rampage , the murderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if that is the only way to save himself . In this and other situations outside of war , the morality of defense is asymmetrical between wrongful aggressors and innocent victims ( and third parties who attempt to defend them ) . While the victim has both a right against attack and a right of defense , the aggressor has neither . This asymmetrical understanding of the morality of defense is found even in the traditional doctrine of jus ad bellum , for the Theory accepts that the morality of defense among states is asymmetrical . It is only in the doctrine of jus in bello , which applies to combatants , that the morality of defense is symmetrical . The Theory thus comprises two distinct accounts of the morality of defense -- an asymmetrical account for states and a symmetrical account for combatants . <p> Self-Defense by Civilians <p> According to the second , symmetrical account , all combatants are liable to defensive attack simply because they pose a threat to others . Curiously , however , they are in general liable to attack only by other combatants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that civilians can attack defensively only when they are being intentionally attacked , in which case the attacking combatants are indeed liable to defensive attack by the civilians . Yet there are actually three other ways in which attacks by civilians against combatants can be defensive : <p> -- Civilians might attack combatants to defend themselves against being harmed as an unintended effect of the combatants ' military action -- that is , to prevent themselves from becoming " collateral damage . " <p> -- Civilians might attack enemy combatants in defense of combatants on their own side . Not all defense is self -defense . <p> -- Civilians might attack combatants to prevent themselves from being harmed by the achievement of the adversary 's war aims , for example to defend their property or liberty , just as soldiers do when they fight in defense of territory or political independence . <p> The issue of self-defense by civilians against combatants has received only scant attention in the just war tradition . But since it would be highly implausible to suppose that civilians have no right of self-defense against an intentional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Theory permits this form of defense . <p> It is also generally assumed that it prohibits the last of these types of defense , primarily on the ground that self-defense in these circumstances is tantamount to participation in the war without identifying oneself as a combatant , and tends to undermine respect for the distinction between combatants and noncombatants . ( The second and third types have been so little discussed in the tradition that I will not consider them here . ) Yet if the Theory recognizes that civilians have a right to defend themselves against soldiers who will otherwise intentionally physically harm them , consistency demands that it also recognize that they are permitted to defend themselves against soldiers who will otherwise expose them to the harms involved in defeat , such as rule by an alien regime that may steal their land and other possessions , dismantle their political institutions , and imprison or kill them if they later resist . In part because these latter harms can be long-lasting , they can be more serious than those that civilians might suffer from an intentional physical attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civilians have a right of defense against a lesser harm but not against a greater harm inflicted by the same people ? <p> Leif Parsons <p> Although the Theory permits civilians to defend themselves against intentional attack by combatants , it also reduces their moral status if they do so . For if civilians attempt to defend themselves , they then pose a threat and hence satisfy the Theory 's criterion of liability to attack . Thus , by engaging in self-defense , they cease to be innocent and become legitimate targets . It does not matter that the only reason they pose a threat is that the unjust attack to which they have been subjected has forced them to try to defend themselves . If that exempted them from liability for posing a threat , it would also exempt just combatants who fight in defense only because they and their innocent compatriots have been unjustifiably attacked . <p> Defenders of the Theory will doubtless recoil from the conclusion that by intentionally attacking civilians , combatants can create conditions in which they may then permissibly kill those same civilians in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Implications of the Claim That All Combatants Are Liable to Attack <p> The foregoing criticisms involve an element of speculation because the Theory has never had a fully explicit and determinate view about the permissibility of defense by civilians against combatants . But it has never been vague about the claim that all combatants are liable to attack by other combatants at any time during a state of war ( assuming that soldiers who are wounded , have surrendered , or are attempting to surrender have ceased to pose a threat and are thus no longer combatants ) . It is worth noting two implications of this claim , one repugnant , the other doubtfully coherent . <p> Suppose that unjust combatants are engaged in a continuing atrocity , such as a massacre of civilians . Just combatants arrive and attack them as a means of stopping the slaughter . According to the Theory , even though the unjust combatants are acting impermissibly in killing the civilians , they nevertheless act permissibly if they kill those who are trying to rescue the civilians . It is hard to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more damaging objection is that the Theory 's claim that all combatants are liable because they pose a threat to others seems incompatible with its further claim that combatants do no wrong when they initiate a war with a surprise attack on the unmobilized forces of another state . If the aggressing combatants act permissibly , that must be because those they attack are legitimate targets -- that is , because they are liable to attack . Yet at the time they are attacked they pose no threat . <p> A defender of the Theory might respond that all combatants pose a threat in a state of war and that a state of war exists when the first act of war occurs . To test the plausibility of this claim , consider the position of an American sailor at Pearl Harbor immediately prior to the Japanese surprise attack . He has done nothing to lose his right not to be attacked by the Japanese . There is no state of war between the United States and Japan , so this sailor poses no threat to any Japanese . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is attacked , but that does not mean that he poses a threat to anyone now . If it did , that would mean that most people pose a threat to others most of the time , since most people would defend themselves if attacked . So the sailor seems not to pose a threat and thus to retain his right against attack . Yet when the Japanese crews conduct their surprise attack , they act permissibly according to the Theory , even though their attack violates the principles of jus ad bellum . For those principles apply only to their government , not to the crews . <p> But how can it be that the crews act permissibly if they attack this American sailor , along with many others like him , who pose no threat to them ? The answer I suggested on behalf of the Theory is that the Japanese attack itself creates a state of war in which the morality of jus in bello comes into effect . A surprise attack that initiates a war thus activates the morality by which it is governed . Prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American sailor had a right not to be attacked . But when the attack occurs , a state of war exists and he has lost his right not to be attacked by enemy combatants . How did he lose it ? The only answer the Theory can give is : by being attacked . <p> But this can not be right , for two obvious reasons . <p> First , as I noted , it is incompatible with the Theory 's criterion of liability , for the sailor posed no threat at the time when he was attacked . Second , it assumes that unjust combatants who initiate a war through a surprise attack deprive their victims of their right not to be attacked merely by attacking them . Yet a right not to be attacked that disappears when its bearer is attacked is no right at all . <p> Is War Governed by a Different Morality ? <p> I remarked earlier that symmetrical accounts of the morality of defense have no plausibility outside the context of war . Defenders of the Theory seem to recognize this , for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary life that it must be governed by principles different from those that operate in other contexts . Traditional just war theorists are thus in partial agreement with political realists , who also claim that ordinary moral principles do not apply in war . The difference is that realists make the radical claim that no alternative moral principles fill the space vacated by ordinary morality , so that war is outside the scope of morality altogether , while traditional just war theorists make only the more modest claim that when war begins , the familiar asymmetrical account of defensive rights ceases to apply to combatants and is replaced by the symmetrical account found in the doctrine of jus in bello . <p> Leif Parsons <p> The idea that conditions of war summon a different set of moral principles into effect is common but highly implausible . If it were true , the concept of war would be of the utmost practical significance . For whether a particular conflict is a war would determine which set of moral principles apply to the acts of those involved in it . A particular act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it occurs is a war , yet be an instance of murder if the conflict falls short war . The difference between wars and conflicts that are not wars would therefore have to be sufficiently significant to explain how the same act could be permissible in the one context but murder in the other . <p> By what criteria , then , are wars distinguished from other conflicts ? A recent op-ed piece in The New York Times by Joshua Goldstein and Steven Pinker noted that " a common definition of war picks out armed conflicts that cause at least 1,000 battle deaths a year . " This criterion is , however , merely a matter of scale . Combining it with the idea that different , symmetrical moral principles come into effect in a state of war yields absurd conclusions . The combined claims imply , for example , that all killings committed in a conflict that continues over many years are permissible in those years in which more than 1000 participants are killed but not during those years when fewer than 1000 are killed . Or suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressors manage to do any killing . Their first 1000 killings are all murders but any killings they do after that are permissible acts of war . <p> As a matter of law , a war exists whenever one state uses armed force against another , regardless of the scale or duration of the conflict . When this happens , something of considerable legal significance does occur : the law of armed conflict begins to govern belligerent relations between the states . But this is a wholly conventional phenomenon and there is no reason to suppose that what is sufficient to activate a certain body of law automatically activates a different set of moral principles as well . <p> The truth is that there is no univocal concept of war . There are various different criteria for distinguishing between wars and other forms of armed conflict that are invoked in different contexts and for different reasons . What is notable here is that traditional just war theorists have not advanced any criterion of their own that would make it plausible to suppose that the commencement of war suspends the moral principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different principles into effect instead . <p> The Revisionist Alternative <p> There are many incoherencies and inconsistencies in the traditional theory of the just war of which those noted in this article are merely a sampling . But the implausibility of the traditional theory should not lead us to conclude that no plausible account of the just war can be given . Revisionist theorists have been working not just to expose the problems with the Theory but also to develop an alternative . The revisionist approach treats war as morally continuous with other forms of violent conflict and therefore rejects the idea that a different morality comes into effect in conditions of war . It asserts that the principles of jus ad bellum apply not only to governments but also to individual soldiers , who in general ought not to fight in wars that are unjust . It denies that jus in bello can be independent of jus ad bellum and therefore concludes that in general it is not possible to fight in a way that is objectively permissible in an unjust war . <p> As these claims imply , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asymmetrical understanding of the morality of defense . While just combatants are usually justified in attacking unjust combatants , unjust combatants are seldom justified in attacking just combatants . The main exception is when just combatants are acting impermissibly , for example by pursuing their just goals by impermissible means . But the fact that most acts of war by unjust combatants are objectively impermissible does not entail that unjust combatants are blameworthy or deserving of punishment . Revisionists recognize that combatants act under duress and in conditions of factual and moral uncertainty . These mitigating conditions usually diminish their responsibility for the wrongs they do , sometimes making their action wholly excusable ( though not objectively justified ) . Many revisionists , myself included , argue that in current conditions , it would be both unfair and counterproductive to subject soldiers to legal punishment for mere participation in an unjust war . <p> These revisionists therefore accept that it is necessary , at least at present , for the law of war to retain a code of jus in bello that is symmetrical between just and unjust combatants . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war as it applies to combatants must at present diverge not only from morality but also from domestic criminal law , which assigns asymmetrical defensive rights to wrongful aggressors and their potential victims . The principal reasons for this are the absence of a publicly accessible and morally and legally authoritative means of distinguishing between just and unjust wars , and the absence of an impartial , supranational mechanism for enforcing an asymmetrical code . What revisionists hope is that their work can be a source of guidance in establishing new international institutions that will eventually make it possible to reform the law of armed conflict in ways that will bring it

##431452 <p> Guillaume Canet 's terrific , Csar-winning thriller Tell No One begins with Franois Cluzet surrounded by his wife , sister , and friends at dinner outside a country house , enjoying a low-key vacation that includes private romantic interludes and bitch-sessions . Then a mystery attacker assaults Cluzet and his wife , leaving him in a coma , suspected of her murder , and caught up in a propulsive tangle of lies , secrets , betrayals , and battles . Unfortunately , Canet 's 2010 film Little White Lies feels like Tell No One minus that inciting incident , and therefore minus the plot . It once again claps Cluzet into a country-home vacation amid old friends with conflicting agendas , but while the self-pity gets chokingly thick , the cast of privileged , navel-gazing characters have no outside antagonist , and no one to blame for their trials but themselves . <p> Little White Lies ' fundamental problem is that it 's hard to empathize with characters who have so little empathy themselves . Cluzet plays a hotelier/restaurateur rich enough to afford a lavish coastal vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spends his time raging or stewing over petty issues with the house , and refusing to let his friends pay for things , then loudly decrying their failure to contribute . His vindictiveness and volatility make him a nightmare vacation partner , let alone host , but all his companions have their own problems with brittle self-absorption : One married-with-kids friend ( The Piano Teacher ' s Benot Magimel ) has just awkwardly revealed his crush on Cluzet , discomfiting them both . Laurent Lafitte is obsessed with his banal texting with an old flame , and badgers everyone with endless calls for advice and analysis . Gilles Lellouche ( Mesrine : Killer Instinct ) cheated on his girlfriend , got dumped , and is lying about it while fretting over how to get her back . And Marion Cotillard is finding that casual sex with active avoidance of emotional connection has multiple downsides . As each of these blinkered characters goes through a crisis period , they alternate yelling , crying , and tense interludes with sloppy partying , in ways that suggest none of them care as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild , middle-aged hedonism . <p> Meanwhile , another member of the group ( The Artist ' s Jean Dujardin ) has been badly injured in a coke-and-booze-fueled accident . Their decision to leave him in the hospital and take their planned vacation drives some of the film 's drama , but establishes them early as selfish , self-justifying , and petty -- perhaps in an understandable way , but to a degree that hugely undermines the film 's attempts to humanize them and make their problems relatable . <p> Little White Lies has been called a French take on The Big Chill , due to the all-star cast , the coming-of-middle-age themes , and the striking soundtrack , which relies heavily on English-language classics : The Band , Gladys Knight , David Bowie , Janis Joplin , Creedence Clearwater Revival , The Isley Brothers , and much more . But it also recalls The Big Chill in its trumped-up melodrama among people whose problems either are n't that weighty , or are unconvincingly overwritten . While the acting is superb -- Cotillard is always impressive , and Magimel in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film flounders with repetition , baggy self-indulgence , characters that read like caricatures , and a crushingly unsubtle and unsurprising last-act twist . At one point , French singer Maxim Nucci shows up to try to see his former lover Cotillard .

But his self-aware , kind character makes her and her friends look even more awful , and the strength of the scenes built around him makes the rest of the movie seem windy and hollow .

##450851 <h> How to Keep the Sabbath Day Holy <p> Sabbath-keeping reflects our relationship with God . How can we recapture positive principles and grow in this area ? <p> Exodus 19 and 20 talk about how God , when He gave the Ten Commandments , caused the earth to tremble and shake -- the manifestations were absolutely awesome . God said He came to test them " that His fear may be before you , so that you may not sin " ( Exodus 20:20 And Moses said unto the people , Fear not : for God is come to prove you , and that his fear may be before your faces , that ye sin not . See All ... ) . <p> How do we respond to these words ? In this article we are not talking about proving the Sabbath . We are really talking about what we need to do as members of God 's Church in keeping this particular day . <h> A Test Commandment <p> We have talked for many , many years about the fact that the Sabbath is a test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with His law . And we have come to realize that judgment begins at the house of God ( 1 Peter 4:17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God : and if it first begin at us , what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God ? See All ... ) . Many times people think of this judgment as condemnation . But it 's a process of evaluation , of learning , of growing , of walking with God . We are the people of God and He is showing us how to observe this day and to keep His laws in the way that He intends so that we can be prepared to enter His family . <p> One of the most important things that we can understand about this subject is that our job is to continually expand our understanding of God 's law concerning the Sabbath . <p> So how we keep the Sabbath says something about us . God wants to learn something about our character , what we are going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to grow in understanding not only the letter of the law , but the spirit . <p> God made a very special Sabbath covenant with His people back in Exodus 31 . We see from that chapter that the Sabbath is an identifying sign of God 's people . It identifies people , not agreements . And so the Sabbath day is a very important day , not greater than the other nine commandments , but a part of the Ten Commandments and a sign between us and our Creator . As we serve Him on this day , there is something special that we learn about the Sabbath . <p> Ezekiel wrote about the severe consequences when the people defiled God 's Sabbaths ( Ezekiel 20:11-13 11 And I gave them my statutes , and shewed them my judgments , which if a man do , he shall even live in them . 12 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them . 13 But the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in my statutes , and they despised my judgments , which if a man do , he shall even live in them ; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted : then I said , I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness , to consume them . <p> See All ... ) . God was very serious about the Sabbath being a test commandment . How we keep God 's Sabbath tells God something about how much we really want to be in His family . <p> The Jews were convinced that the Sabbath was the primary reason they went into captivity . So they proceeded to make rules for their Sabbath . But they went into the other ditch , becoming so " pharisaical " that they developed 39 categories of activities that comprised " work " -- everything from swatting a fly to helping an injured man . No wonder Christ condemned the Pharisees . But if that ditch is wrong , the other ditch is wrong as well . There is a balance . <p> I am not trying to create some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our ministers have asked for a little bit more information on Sabbath-keeping , because in the early ' 90s it was watered down . The observance of the Sabbath became in many cases something different than it was years before . People began to dress inappropriately . People treated the Sabbath as simply another day rather than a feast day , a special day . They did n't get involved as they used to in preparing for it and looking forward to it . And so all I am trying to do is to reemphasize some of these areas to help us better understand how we should keep the Sabbath . <p> I think the most interesting thing that happened after I gave a sermon on this subject was how many young people from age 18 to 30 came up and said they had never heard things like that before . And that was shocking to me because it made me realize that we have n't spoken on this topic for a long time . <p> I am not here to judge the intent of your heart . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to keep God 's law every Sabbath . <h> Four Primary Principles <p> There are four primary principles of Sabbath-keeping . First , the commandment tells us not to work . This means not to make a productive increase from working -- receiving pay and so on . <p> Second , the commandment tells us to rest . This does not mean that we stay in bed all day . Rest means to change the overall approach that we have from the six days of go , go , go and work , work , work , to being able to just stop and enjoy the day . <p> Third , we are told to assemble with others for worship . We are required to congregate . It is a part of true Christianity . You really ca n't just be a living room Christian . A great part of keeping God 's law has to do with interaction and involvement with the people of God on a regular basis . <p> Leviticus 23:3 Six days shall work be done : but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therein : it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings . See All ... says that it is a holy convocation . The word implies the product of official summons to worship . To put it another way , God said be there . When we receive a summons to appear in court , what do we do ? We take it seriously . Similarly , God has said to us that we should respond by being here . <p> There was a man in one of the churches a few years ago who brought a portable dialysis machine in his truck so he could be at church ! And there are many wonderful examples of people who desperately want to be at church . <p> The fourth point is that . Hebrews 10:25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but exhorting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching . See All ... says we need to be gathering ourselves together so much more as we " see the Day approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , to hear the sermon and sermonette . Apostasy sets in when Christian fellowship becomes lukewarm . <p> It is very important that we gather together to help and encourage the brethren , and to allow them to give us encouragement when we have need after a bad week . We receive prayer updates and find ways we can serve the brethren . <p> The Sabbath was designed to serve mankind ( Mark 2:27 And he said unto them , The sabbath was made for man , and not man for the sabbath : See All ... ) . On it we learn about life 's purposes , why we 're here , where we 're headed . Most important , we learn how to live . <p> Proper Sabbath observance allows us to develop and maintain a personal relationship with both the human family and the spiritual family of God . <h> Reverencing God 's Sanctuary <p> Part of properly keeping the Sabbath is reverencing God 's sanctuary ( Leviticus 19:30 Ye shall keep my sabbaths , and reverence my sanctuary : I am the LORD . See All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress and the way we get to church on time . We need to be in our seats , ready to be a part of the song service , the sermonette and the sermon . <p> We need to have our " wedding garment " on ( Matthew 22:11-14 11 And when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment : 12 And he saith unto him , Friend , how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment ? And he was speechless . 13 Then said the king to the servants , Bind him hand and foot , and take him away , and cast him into outer darkness ; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth . 14 For many are called , but few are chosen . <p> See All ... ) . We need to be properly attired , wearing the best we have . It 's like the high priest who on the Day of Atonement wore a special garment to show respect and reverence ( Leviticus 16:4 He shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the linen breeches upon his flesh , and shall be girded with a linen girdle , and with the linen mitre shall he be attired : these are holy garments ; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water , and so put them on . See All ... ) . <h> The Preparation Day <p> Exodus 20:8 Remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy . See All ... says , " Remember the Sabbath day , to keep it holy . " It is interesting that the word remember is used . The Soncino commentary says this means we should always keep the Sabbath in mind during the week . If we are thinking about the Sabbath , then we will begin to make some of the modern-day preparations that are needed . <p> Instead of running for six days and coming to an abrupt stop all of a sudden when the sun goes down , we can take the opportunity to begin to switch gears early enough to think about what we are going to do . For example , shining our shoes , pressing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do with our children . <p> One of the most enjoyable times for my wife and me was when we had Friday nights together as a family . Every Friday night we would have one of our favorite meals . The first time it would be my daughter 's choice , the second time my son 's , the third time my wife 's and last of all the old man 's . <p> We shut everything down and it became our time . Sometimes we would go downstairs and play a game . Sometimes we would sit in front of the fireplace and talk and have our dessert there . It was very special . <h> The Dos <p> Now , with the principles of Sabbath-keeping that we have gone through , we must individually grow in proper judgment , continually expanding our understanding of God 's laws concerning the Sabbath . In this article , rather than giving you the don'ts , I want to give you the dos . I want to show you some very positive things you can do based on the teachings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away thy foot from the sabbath , from doing thy pleasure on my holy day ; and call the sabbath a delight , the holy of the LORD , honourable ; and shalt honour him , not doing thine own ways , nor finding thine own pleasure , nor speaking thine own words : 14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD ; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth , and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father : for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it . <p> See All ... says , " If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath , from doing your pleasure on My holy day , and call the Sabbath a delight , the holy of the LORD honorable , and shall honor Him , not doing your own ways , nor finding your own pleasure , nor speaking your own words , then you shall delight yourself in the LORD ; and I will cause you to ride on the high hills of the earth , and feed you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the context of the right kind of fasting and the wrong kind of fasting mentioned earlier in Isaiah 58 , God then addresses the Sabbath . As with fasting , God contrasts the right approach to His holy time and the wrong approach . The right approach will cause God to take notice , enhance our relationship and cause us to take delight in the things that are eternal . <p> We have to be careful that our Sabbath does not degenerate into a meaningless weekly ritual . There is more to the Sabbath than simply acknowledging that it is Saturday and not Sunday , and not working , and of course going to church . The Sabbath is set apart for a particular purpose , and this is the positive side of understanding what we should be doing with the Sabbath . <p> So let 's start with a question that many people raise . How do I use my television set ? What about my computer ? What about a radio ? What about printed material such as books and magazines and newspapers ? <p> The world we live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we use these vehicles on the Sabbath will depend on our interpretation of Isaiah 58:13-14 13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath , from doing thy pleasure on my holy day ; and call the sabbath a delight , the holy of the LORD , honourable ; and shalt honour him , not doing thine own ways , nor finding thine own pleasure , nor speaking thine own words : 14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD ; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth , and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father : for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it . <p> See All ... . Do we use these vehicles for personal entertainment ? Do we use these vehicles for information ? <p> The Sabbath turns out to be a day of highly positive import . It liberates man for meeting God . Do these vehicles help you do that ? This is what you have to evaluate . These are some of the questions we must judge in our Sabbath-keeping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . Let 's say that there are some people who spend seven hours watching television on the Sabbath . They might decide to watch an R-rated movie on Friday night . Now to me that is one ditch . The other side of that might be simply turning it off and never using it at all , when there are some things that can be used in a proper way . <p> Sabbath observance is not a burden . It liberates man for meeting God . It is a day of joy . It is a day of delight . The person who calls the Sabbath a delight is one who delights in the Lord . Our thinking begins to shift . We worship God and find enjoyment through and in Him and in what He provides , both spiritually and physically . <h> Our Ways Vs . God 's Ways <p> Isaiah 58 contrasts our ways versus God 's ways . God claims the Sabbath day as His , and I think the Sabbath is to be a pleasurable and an enjoyable day . It is to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy ? Not the same thing that makes the world around us " happy " -- not just physical pleasures . We focus on the spiritual aspects of the day , thinking about God , getting closer to God , learning about His ways . In essence God says , " Pay attention to Me on the Sabbath . Treat the Sabbath as an honor to Me . " When you begin to do that , you find that television , radio and the computer all find their proper place . But their place is not in spending hours watching R-rated movies on the Sabbath . That just does n't seem to be the ditch the Christian should be in . <p> In verse 14 God shows that we are going to be a part of His Kingdom . Thinking about those things on the Sabbath day and the life we have chosen becomes a very important thing . <p> Isaiah 58:13-14 13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath , from doing thy pleasure on my holy day ; and call the sabbath a delight , the holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not doing thine own ways , nor finding thine own pleasure , nor speaking thine own words : 14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD ; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth , and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father : for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it . <p> See All ... tell us to focus on God and not self . Secondly , they tell us to focus on the eternal things and not the trivial . That is basically God and the big picture . It is not saying it would be wrong to think about other things , more mundane things , but the big picture should take center stage . <p> The Sabbath pictures the Millennium . The Sabbath pictures the coming of Christ to bring God 's government . And so from the concept of , " Where your treasure is , there your heart will be also , " we recognize that if our thoughts are only on our own interests , our own pursuits and our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In Isaiah 58:13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath , from doing thy pleasure on my holy day ; and call the sabbath a delight , the holy of the LORD , honourable ; and shalt honour him , not doing thine own ways , nor finding thine own pleasure , nor speaking thine own words : See All ... , " your own ways " means the course of life , your employment , your enterprises , your finances , the serious business of making a living that we have to do six days a week . We do n't involve ourselves in working at that on the Sabbath day . We do that the rest of the week . Those things by which you feed , clothe and care for yourself physically , you put away . You remove yourself from that and you begin to think about those areas that are important spiritually . <p> Forsaking " your own pleasure " does not mean the Sabbath is a rigorous day of abstinence . I found that those Friday nights with my children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brethren after church services or being able to enjoy a picnic or a walk in nature was very much a part of having our mind and our energies taken up in that Sabbath attitude . <p> " Nor speaking your words " : I think this is a spiritual application of the first two principles . " Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks " ( Matthew 12:34 O generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh . See All ... ) . What we talk about , what we are thinking is known every Sabbath day when we talk with the brethren . <h> Making the Sabbath a Delight <p> Now let 's look at some ideas about making the Sabbath a delight . I told you about one that my family did for many years when my children were at home . <p> The Sabbath can also be a chance to visit the sick and the widows . When we begin to reach outside of ourselves , wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time to write a letter or a card of encouragement to someone . It 's wonderful to know someone was thinking about you and cared enough to send you a card . <p> Studying the Word of God and reviewing God 's plan is another important use of the Sabbath . It is a crazy world we live in right now . Find escape in what God is going to do , and realize that it is going to happen because He ca n't lie . Take the time to review God 's plan . <p> The Sabbath is also a good time for talking about goals , about the future , especially the spiritual future ahead . I find that looking back on what God has done for us , and then looking forward to what He is going to do , is very encouraging . This is a day to think about the positive things , to reach forward and to reach upward . <p> Some people read sections of the Bible that deal with God as Creator , the Sabbath theme , and then watch videos or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some wonderful videos from Moody Bible Institute about different aspects of the creation . Focus on the Family also has some wonderful videos on family . <p> Take a walk in the park . Sometimes , we do n't get a chance to smell the roses . Alvin Toffler said we are stressing ourselves half to death . The Sabbath gives us a chance to reverse that . <p> Have interactive discussions with your family about newspaper and magazine articles on current events and prophecy . Talk about the problems of the world and the solutions that God is going to bring . <p> Special family time at meals is very important . I found one of the most enjoyable things was having a picnic in the park after Sabbath services , where you just sit down , take off your tie and visit with a group of brethren . Or have a potluck at home . Have special friends over Friday evening . <p> So considering all these things , how much would you get involved with the world coming into your house during the Sabbath ? Probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Sabbath is a wonderful gift that God has given us in worshipping Him . Generally today the tendency is to take the Sabbath for granted . More people seem to be too liberal with the Sabbath than those who are too strict . I hope we will get back to remembering these important things . <p> Notice what the prophet Ezekiel says to us . " I gave them My statutes and showed them My judgments , ' which , if a man does , he shall live by them . ' Moreover I also gave them My Sabbaths , to be a sign between them and Me , that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them " ( Ezekiel 20:11-12 11 And I gave them my statutes , and shewed them my judgments , which if a man do , he shall even live in them . 12 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them . <p> See All ... ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Israel forsook God and the holy time that He set aside . They paid the price for it , a very dear price to pay . <p> Can we assume that if God held a whole nation accountable for breaking the Sabbath , that He would spare one individual ? We as a Church need to take the Sabbath more seriously . I think we need to understand that perhaps we 've let some things slip . <p> We must keep the Sabbath holy because our salvation depends on it . I hope you will bring these basic principles back to your Sabbath-keeping and allow it to make your Sabbath day most enjoyable and most delightful . UN <p> This article is based on two sermons given in the Cincinnati East , Ohio , congregation Feb. 7 and March 6 , 2004 . The full transcripts are available at **35;324;TOOLONG . <h> What About Ox-in-the-Ditch Situations ? <p> What about the ox in the ditch ( Luke 14:1-6 1 And it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 And , behold , there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy. 3 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ? 4 And they held their peace . And he took him , and healed him , and let him go ; 5 And answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day ? 6 And they could not answer him again to these things . <p> See All ... ) ? Sometimes people look at their job or their situation as an ox in the ditch . The Bible shows that emergencies , ox-in-the-ditch situations , justify work . When one has a legitimate emergency , a life-or-death illness or accident , he or she is not condemned for doing what is necessary to meet the challenge of the emergency . <h> Dealing With Legitimate Emergencies <p> The Second Narrows Bridge between North Vancouver , British Columbia , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water from this high bridge . Many died and some were badly injured . A member of the Church in Vancouver -- a nurse at a hospital -- was asked to come to work . She worked an entire shift during that time because there was death , mayhem and confusion . There was an emergency where they needed to have trained people there . This lady had always told her boss that she could not come in from Friday night sunset until Saturday night sunset , and they honored that . But they said to her , " We have an emergency that we have never had before . Will you come ? " And she said , " Yes , I will . " <p> We had a man in the Church who used to work on high power lines . He made sure his boss knew that he would not be there to work on the Sabbath . But one Friday night there was a terrible , terrible storm . He had to spend eight hours taking care of lines that had fallen across roads and would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . The nurse let her boss know . These people recognized that if their bosses were to continue time after time asking them to come to work , then they would have to face the question , What is a legitimate emergency and what is created by the boss ? <p> Someone asked the question , How do you handle situations when responsibilities considered critical by your company keep encroaching into Friday evening ? I think the answer is that we have to begin to plan ahead to avoid foreseeable " emergencies . " If they continue to encroach upon the Sabbath , you may need to find another place to work . <p> But in most cases -- I would say in 99 percent of cases -- when people plan ahead and talk to their employer and explain their needs , it all works out . And then there may be a legitimate emergency that requires you to make a judgment . <h> Is the Sabbath Worth Dying For ? <p> Someone asked another question : If you could not find a way to survive because every occupation required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying for ? <p> Strong question , is n't it ? But there 's a scripture that addresses it . It 's found in the context of Shadrach , Meshach and Abed-Nego and the fiery furnace . They , too , faced this question of faith . They refused to bow down to the image , to break one of the Ten Commandments , and the king said he would throw them in the furnace . <p> They responded , " If that is the case , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace , and He will deliver us from your hand ... But if not , let it be known to you , O king , that we do not serve your gods , nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up " ( Daniel 3:17-18 17 If it be so , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace , and he will deliver us out of thine hand , O king . 18 But if not , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not serve thy gods , nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up . <p> We have found over the past 45 to 50 years that most people who have held their ground and obeyed God 's Sabbath command have found a way to make it through the problem and actually be blessed ! But you must understand , this is not an ox in the ditch . It comes down to a matter of a choice about God 's Word and God 's law . Now some people , if they are weak in faith , may give in to something . But you will find that over a period of time you will be convicted , and you will be finding yourself having to either decide to justify or to realize that you are going to have to carry out that command regardless of what men say or think or do . <h> Eating Out on the Sabbath <p> The question of eating out on the Sabbath sometimes comes up . We have a paper , " Principles of Sabbath Observance , Eating Out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ www.ucg.org/papers if you wish to get a copy . It goes through all of the scriptures and all of the principles that have to do with eating out on the Sabbath . The Church has never taught that it was wrong or a violation of the Sabbath to eat in a restaurant on the Sabbath . Clearly Christianity involves an individual choice as to what you do . It is a judgment that individuals have to make . <p> Paul took certain positions about not eating meat if it made someone stumble . But the act itself of going out to eat is not a matter of sin . It is the view of the Church that it is not a violation of the Scriptures if one chooses to eat out . <p> Those who object to purchasing a meal on the Sabbath usually base their argument from two principles -- causing someone else to work on the Sabbath or exchanging money on the Sabbath . There are two scriptures they use , one in Nehemiah 13 , and the other in Amos . <p> If you look at these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why the Church teaches what it teaches . The prohibition that you find in both places is against setting up a market on the Sabbath or a Holy Day . The Jews had become a people that made the Sabbath a secular day where it was acceptable to go to a market . The principle expressed in these scriptures is , do n't make the Sabbath a market day or a day to do your weekly shopping . <p> Nehemiah 13 has nothing to do with eating out in a restaurant . After you look at the scriptures on the subject , if you as an individual feel compelled not to eat out at a restaurant on the Sabbath , so be it . No one should look down , no one should criticize , no one should judge . We simply ask that individuals keep that as a personal decision and not make efforts to persuade others , because this is a teaching of the Church . We must understand that attempts to persuade others is divisive , and that behavior simply can not be tolerated in the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rediscovering the Sabbath <p> Nan Chase , a writer of Jewish background , wrote an interesting article about rediscovering the Sabbath . Here are excerpts : <p> " In a moment of divine inspiration I decided to try an old-fashioned cure for my space-age blues . It is called the Sabbath . And it 's a mental health tool that works as well today as it did 3,200 years ago ... <p> " Now if someone told you that there was a way to stop the onslaught of everyday obligations , improve your social life , keep the house clean , revive your tired marriage , elevate spiritual awareness , improve productivity at work , all overnight without cost , you would probably say the claim was absurd . I certainly did , but I was willing to see if some cosmic miracle cure might really work ... <p> " No shopping or paying bills , no pulling weeds or pruning shrubs , nor cleaning or repairing the house .

##453052 business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article . ( More ... ) <p> Looking at profitability is a very important step in understanding a company . Profitability is essentially why the company exists and a key component in deciding whether to invest or to remain invested in a company . There are many metrics involved in calculating profitability , but for this article , I will look at BP PLC 's ( BP ) earnings and earnings growth , profit margins , profitability ratios and cash flow . <p> Over the past 5 years the economy and subsequently energy prices have been hit hard . Through the above-mentioned four main metrics we will get an idea about the company 's profitability over past 5 years . We will also get an idea how hard BP BPC was hit by the crisis , how the gulf spill affected the company financially and how well the company is recovering . By comparing this summary to other companies such as Chevron ( CVX ) , and Exxon ( XOM ) who are in the same sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most profitable . <p> In looking at BP 's 2010 earnings we can see the impact that the tragic accident that claimed 11 lives and injured many more on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico had on the company . In 2010 the company spent $40.858 billion on " Gulf of Mexico oil spill response " which greatly affected the company 's earnings in 2010 . Due to the tragic events in the Gulf of Mexico in April of 2010 , the company reported a loss of $ 3.719 billion . <p> 2 . Five-year historical look at earnings growth <p> 2007 - $ 20.845 billion , 39.54% increase over 2006 <p> 2008 - $ 21.157 billion , 1.50% increase <p> 2009 - $ 16.578 billion , 21.64% decrease <p> 2010 - $ ( 3.719 ) billion , <p> 2011 - $ 25.700 billion , <p> In looking at BP 's earnings over the past five years , you can see how the economic crisis had an affect on the earnings in 2009 . But in comparing the decline to its competitors such as Exxon who 's earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 128.28% , BP 's earnings held up relatively well . Even though the earnings decreased by over 20 percent in 2009 the company still posted earnings of $16.578 billion . <p> In 2010 , the earnings decreased to $- 3.719 billion due to the gulf disaster . <p> In 2011 , BP reported earnings of $ 25.700 billion which was above the previous 5 year peak of $21.157 billion reported in 2008 . <p> Profit Margins <p> 3 . Gross Profit = Total Sales - Cost of Sales <p> In analyzing a company , gross profit is very important because it indicates how efficiently management uses labor and supplies in the production process . More specifically , it can be used to calculate gross profit margin . Here are BP 's gross profits for the past two years : <p> 2010 - $ 302.545 billion - $ 280.826 billion = $ 21.719 billion <p> 2011 - $ 386.463 billion - $ 309.763 billion = $ 76.700 billion <p> 4 . Gross Profit Margin = Gross Income / Sales <p> The gross profit margin is a measurement of a company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross profit tells an investor the percentage of revenue/sales left after subtracting the cost of goods sold . A company that boasts a higher gross profit margin than its competitors and industry is more efficient . Investors tend to pay more for businesses that have higher efficiency ratings than their competitors , as these businesses should be able to make a decent profit as long as overhead costs are controlled ( overhead refers to rent , utilities , etc . ) . <p> In reviewing BP 's gross margin over the past five years , we can see the impact the financial crisis had on the company 's sales , but we can also see that the margin held up very well . The 5-year low for the gross margin was reported in 2010 with a margin of 7.18 % but t he 5-year high for the margin was in 2009 with a margin of 21.82 % . The 2011 gross profit margin of 19.85% was below the 5-year average subtract 2010 , of 20.30% . <p> 2007 - $ 61.514 billion / $ 288.951 billion = 21.29% <p> 2008 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 - $ 53.239 billion / $ 243.965 billion = 21.82% <p> 2010 - $ 21.719 billion / $ 302.545 billion = 7.18% <p> 2011 - $ 76.700 billion / $ 386.463 billion = 19.85% <p> As the gross margin is below the 5-year average this implies that management has been slightly less efficient in the company 's manufacturing and distribution during the production process over the past 5 years . <p> 5 . Operating income = Total Sales - Operating Expenses <p> The amount of profit realized from the operations of a business after taking out operating expenses - such as cost of goods sold ( COGS ) or wages - and depreciation . Operating income takes the gross income ( revenue minus COGS ) and subtracts other operating expenses , then removes depreciation . These operating expenses are costs that are incurred from operating activities and include things such as office supplies and heat and power . <p> 2010 - $ ( 4.825 ) billion <p> 2011 - $38.834 billion <p> 6 . Operating Margin = Operating Income / Total Sales <p> Operating margin is a measure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after paying for variable costs of production , such as wages , raw materials , etc . A healthy operating margin is required for a company to be able to pay for its fixed costs such as interest on debt . If a company 's margin is increasing , it is earning more per dollar of sales . The higher the margin , the better . <p> Over the past five years , BP 's operating margin has remained relatively the same with the exception of 2010 . The 2011 operating margin of 10.05% is inline the peak margin of 10.94% reported in 2007 . <p> 2007 - $ 31.611 billion / $ 288.951 billion = 10.94% <p> 2008 - $ 34.283 billion / $ 365.700 billion = 9.37% <p> 2009 - $ 25.124 billion / $ 243.965 billion = 10.30% <p> 2010 - $ ( 4.825 ) billion / $ 302.545 billion = -1.59% <p> 2011 - $ 38.834 billion / $ 386.463 billion = 10.05% <p> The 2011 operating margin of 10.05 % is slightly below the 5-year average subtract the 2010 margin of 10.16% . This implies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total sales left over after paying for variable costs of production such as wages and raw materials compared to the 5-year average . <p> 7 . Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Total Sales <p> A ratio of profitability calculated as net income divided by revenue , or net profits divided by sales . It measures how much out of every dollar of sales a company actually keeps in earnings . <p> Profit margin is very useful when comparing companies in similar industries . A higher profit margin indicates a more profitable company that has better control over its costs compared to its competitors . Profit margin is displayed as a percentage ; a 20% profit margin , for example , means the company has a net income of $0.20 for each dollar of sales . <p> Like the Operating Margin , BP 's 2011 is below the 2007 peak net profit margin of 7.21% but the 2011 net profit margin of 6.65% is above the 5-year average minus 2010 of 6.61% . <p> 2007 - $ 20.845 billion / $ 288.951 billion = 7.21% <p> 2008 - $ 21.157 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 16.578 billion / $ 243.965 billion = 6.80% <p> 2010 - $ ( 3.719 ) billion / $ 302.545 billion = -1.23% <p> 2011 - $ 25.700 billion / $ 386.463 billion = 6.65% <p> As the 2011 net profit margin of 6.61% is above the 5-year average of 6.61% , this implies that there has been a increase in the percentage of earnings that the company is able to keep compared to the company 's 5-year average . <p> The profitability margins are revealing a few different results . They are showing that over the past 5 years the company 's profitability been very consistent despite the adversity that the company has had to endure . The company endured the financial crisis in 2008/2009 , the subsequent crash in energy prices and the Gulf disaster in 2010 . Despite these setbacks the company 's margins have held up quite well . <p> In 2011 the company was able to withstand other tests regarding profitability : <p> We saw rapid and sometimes unpredictable change . This included escalation of the European debt crisis and political upheaval in countries where BP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We kept a close watch on these developments and acted where required . Our international advisory board assisted us in this task . ( Company website ) <p> As these variables have reduced the potential for profits , the company was still able to be consistent in maintaining its margins . <p> Profitability Ratios <p> 8 . ROA - Return on Assets = Net Income / Total Assets <p> ROA is an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets . ROA gives an idea as to how efficient management is at using its assets to generate earnings . Calculated by dividing a company 's net income by its total assets , ROA is displayed as a percentage . Sometimes this is referred to as " return on investment . " <p> Like the listed profitability margins , the 2011 ROA of BP PLC reveals very consistent results over the past 5 years . The 2011 ROA of 8.77% is above the 5-year average subtract 2010 of 8.48% . <p> 2007 - $ 20.845 billion / $ 236.076 billion = 8.83% <p> 2008 - $ 21.157 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16.578 billion / $ 235.968 billion = 7.03% <p> 2010 - $ ( 3.719 ) billion / $ 272.262 billion = -1.37% <p> 2011 - $ 25.700 billion / $ 293.068 billion = 8.77% <p> As the 2011 ROA of 8.77 % is above the 5-year average of 8.48% , this implies that management has been more able to use the company 's assets to generate earnings compared to its 5-year average . <p> 9 . ROE - Return on Equity = Net Income / Shareholders ' Equity <p> As shareholders ' equity is measured as a firm 's total assets minus its total liabilities , ROE reveals the amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders ' equity . The return on equity measures a company 's profitability by revealing how much profit it generates with the amount shareholders have invested . <p> 2007 - $ 20.845 billion / $ 93.690 billion = 22.25% <p> 2008 - $ 21.157 billion / $ 91.303 billion = 23.17% <p> 2009 - $ 16.578 billion / $ 101.613 billion = 16.31% <p> 2010 - $ ( 3.719 ) billion / $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / $ 111.465 billion = 23.06% <p> Unlike the other margins and ratios , BP PLC 's ROE has revealed a strong dip in 2009 . In looking at the company 's ROE over the past 5 years we can see that the ROE is up around same levels as 2007 and 2008 . As the ROE is up from the 5 year average subtract 2010 , this reveals that there has been an increase in how much profit has been generated compared to the amount that shareholders have invested . <p> Cash Flows <p> 10 . Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditure <p> A measure of financial performance calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures . Free cash flow ( FCF ) represents the cash that a company is able to generate after laying out the money required to maintain or expand its asset base . Free cash flow is important because it allows a company to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value . Without cash , it 's tough to develop new products , make acquisitions , pay dividends and reduce debt . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not bad in itself . If free cash flow is negative , it could be a sign that a company is making large investments . If these investments earn a high return , the strategy has the potential to pay off in the long run . <p> Over four of the past five years , BP PLC 's free cash flow has remained positive . <p> 2007 - $ 24.709 billion - $ 17.830 b illion = $ 6.879 b illion <p> 2008 - $ 38.095 billion - $ 22.658 billion = $ 15.437 billion <p> 2009 - $ 27.716 billion - $ 20.650 billion = $ 7.066 m illion <p> 2010 - $ 13.616 billion - $ 18.421 billion = $ -4.805 billion <p> 2011 - $ 22.154 billion - $ 17.845 billion = $ 4.309 billion <p> Over 4 of the past 5 years BP PLC has had positive cash flow . This indicates that BP PLC has enough cash to develop new products , make acquisitions , pay dividends and reduce debt . <p> If a company is generating a negative cash flow , it shows up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow margin equation . This means that even as the company is generating sales revenue , it is losing money . The company will have to borrow money or raise money through investors in order to keep on operating . <p> As BP PLC 's cash flow margin is positive , it does not have to take the above measures to continue operating . <p> 2007 - $ 24.709 billion / $ 288.951 billion = 8.55% <p> 2008 - $ 38.095 billion / $ 365.700 billion = 10.42% <p> 2009 - $ 27.716 billion / $ 243.965 billion = 11.36% <p> 2010 - $ 13.616 billion / $ 302.545 billion = 4.50% <p> 2011 - $ 22.154 billion / $ 386.463 billion = 5.73% <p> Summary <p> In looking at BP 's earnings over the past five years , you can see how the economic crisis had an affect on the earnings in 2009 . In comparing the 2009 decline to its competitors such as Exxon who 's earnings decreased by 57.36% , and Chevron whose earnings decreased by 128.28% , BP 's earnings held up relatively well . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company still posted earnings of $16.578 billion . <p> In 2010 , the earnings decreased to $- 3.719 billion due to the gulf disaster . <p> In 2011 , BP reported earnings of $ 25.700 billion which was above the previous 5 year peak of $21.157 billion reported in 2008 . <p> The profitability margins are revealing a few different results . They are showing that over the past 5 years the company 's profitability been very consistent despite the adversity that the company has had to endure . The company endured the financial crisis in 2008/2009 , the subsequent crash in energy prices and the Gulf disaster in 2010 . Despite these setbacks the company 's margins have held up quite well . <p> As these variables have tested the potential for profits , the company was still able to be consistent at maintaining its margins compared to its 5 year averages . <p> The ROA and ROE indicate similar results in that both the ROA and ROE are showing similar results as the profit margins . <p> With free cash flow and the free cash flow margin both displaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new products , make acquisitions , pay dividends and reduce debt without having to borrow or raise money to maintain operations . <p> The analysis of BP PBL 's profitability indicates a strong company that has been tested over the past few years . Even with the adversity that the company has been through over the past couple of years , the trends show strong signals for the future as BP PLC has a strong amount of free cash at hand , which means the company will likely continue to grow for the foreseeable future . <p> Looking forward , <p> Energy demand is linked to economic growth , development and population . The world 's population is projected to increase by 1.4 billion over the next 20 years , while its real income is likely to grow by 100% over the same period . <p> This combination of factors is expected to increase world primary energy consumption by approximately 40% over the next 20 years , with non-OECD energy consumption as much as 70% higher by 2030 .

##468751 <h> In a shocking about-face , the administration has launched a government-wide crackdown on medical marijuana <p> Back when he was running for president in 2008 , Barack Obama insisted that medical marijuana was an issue best left to state and local governments . " I 'm not going to be using Justice Department resources to try to circumvent state laws on this issue , " he vowed , promising an end to the Bush administration 's high-profile raids on providers of medical pot , which is legal in 16 states and the District of Columbia . <p> But over the past year , the Obama administration has quietly unleashed a multi-agency crackdown on medical cannabis that goes far beyond anything undertaken by George W. Bush . The feds are busting growers who operate in full compliance with state laws , vowing to seize the property of anyone who dares to even rent to legal pot dispensaries , and threatening to imprison state employees responsible for regulating medical marijuana . With more than 100 raids on pot dispensaries during his first three years , Obama is now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's no question that Obama 's the worst president on medical marijuana , " says Rob Kampia , executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project . " He 's gone from first to worst . " <p> The federal crackdown imperils the medical care of the estimated 730,000 patients nationwide -- many of them seriously ill or dying -- who rely on state-sanctioned marijuana recommended by their doctors . In addition , drug experts warn , the White House 's war on law-abiding providers of medical marijuana will only drum up business for real criminals . " The administration is going after legal dispensaries and state and local authorities in ways that are going to push this stuff back underground again , " says Ethan Nadelmann , director of the Drug Policy Alliance . Gov . Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island , a former Republican senator who has urged the DEA to legalize medical marijuana , pulls no punches in describing the state of affairs produced by Obama 's efforts to circumvent state law : " Utter chaos . " <p> I n its first two years , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shortly after Obama took office , a senior drug-enforcement official pledged to Rolling Stone that the question of whether marijuana is medicine would now be determined by science , " not ideology . " In March 2009 , Attorney General Eric Holder emphasized that the Justice Department would only target medical-marijuana providers " who violate both federal and state law . " The next morning , a headline in The New York Times read OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO STOP RAIDS ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSERS . While all forms of marijuana would remain strictly illegal under federal law -- the DEA ranks cannabis as a Schedule I drug , on par with heroin -- the feds would respect state protections for providers of medical pot . Framing the Obama administration 's new approach , drug czar Gil Kerlikowske famously declared , " We 're not at war with people in this country . " <p> That original hands-off policy was codified in a Justice Department memo written in October 2009 by Deputy Attorney General David Ogden . The so-called " Ogden memo " advised federal law-enforcement officials that the " rational use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical-marijuana patients and their " caregivers " who operate in " clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state law " could be left alone . <p> At the same time , Ogden was concerned that the feds not " be made a fool of " by illegal drug traffickers . In that vein , his memo advised U.S. attorneys to focus on going after pot dispensaries that posed as medicinal but were actively engaged in criminal acts , such as selling to minors , possession of illegal firearms or money-laundering . The idea , as Holder put it , was to raid only those hardcore traffickers who " use medical-marijuana laws as a shield . " <p> The Ogden memo sent a clear message to the states : The feds will only intervene if you allow pot dispensaries to operate as a front for criminal activity . States from New Mexico to Maine moved quickly to license and regulate dispensaries through their state health departments -- giving medical marijuana unprecedented legitimacy . In California , which had allowed " caregivers " to operate dispensaries , medical pot blossomed into a $1.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memo . <p> T he administration 's recognition of medical cannabis reached its high-water mark in July 2010 , when the Department of Veterans Affairs validated it as a legitimate course of treatment for soldiers returning from the front lines . But it did n't take long for the fragile federal detente to begin to collapse . The reversal began at the Drug Enforcement Agency with Michele Leonhart , a holdover from the Bush administration who was renominated by Obama to head the DEA . An anti-medical-marijuana hard-liner , Leonhart had been rebuked in 2008 by House Judiciary chairman John Conyers for targeting dispensaries with tactics " typically reserved for the worst drug traffickers and kingpins . " Her views on the larger drug war are so perverse , in fact , that last year she cited the slaughter of nearly 1,000 Mexican children by the drug cartels as a counterintuitive " sign of success in the fight against drugs . " <p> In January 2011 , weeks after Leonhart was confirmed , her agency updated a paper called " The DEA Position on Marijuana . " With subject headings like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS NOT MEDICINE , the paper simply regurgitated the Bush administration 's ideological stance , in an attempt to walk back the Ogden memo . Sounding like Glenn Beck , the DEA even blamed " George Soros " and " a few billionaires , not broad grassroots support " for sustaining the medical-marijuana movement -- even though polls

##473750 <p> A federal court judge sided Tuesday with a homeless coalition and said Ohio must count provisional ballots cast on Nov. 6 that lack or contain incomplete voter identification information.Secretary of State Jon Husted promptly said his office would appeal the ruling to the Cincinnati-based U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals . On Saturday , county boards of elections will begin to count roughly 200,000 provisional ballots , the ballots of last resort cast on Election Day by voters whose eligibility was in question for a variety of reasons . Voters are given 10 days after the election to correct , if possible , the problem with the ballot . The official count must be completed by Nov. 27 . At issue in the lawsuit was a section of the form that Mr. Husted released as part of the directive that ordered elections boards to reject provisional ballots that are incomplete , and required the voter , rather than the poll worker , to record the form of ID being used , said Subodh Chandra , one of the lawyers who filed the motion . U.S. District Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued the Friday before the election was confusing and unfair to voters and violated a previous decree that made poll workers responsible for that information , as well as Ohio and constitutional law . <p> I 'm wondering how Republicans will square their new interest in attracting younger and browner voters with the voter fraud industry they 've built . What happens to the voter fraud media celebrities like John Fund and Hans von Spakovsky if Republicans make a serious effort to court the same group of voters Fund , Spakovsky and others smear almost daily ? <p> True the Vote was a huge , over-hyped flop in Ohio , they were n't even allowed into Ohio polling places because they did n't manage to complete the credentialing process by election day . Contrast that with the huge volunteer voter protection effort by liberals and Democrats that we 've had in place in Ohio for the last 4 cycles that has operated almost completely under national media radar . Maybe True the Vote should have spent less time holding conventions where conservative celebrities were paid to appear and more time learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing states . <p> Republicans have spent ten years and millions of dollars promoting bogus claims of voter impersonation fraud , they have an entire cadre of media celebrities who push voter fraud , and now they have to attract the same groups of voters those same media celebrities insult and smear . Be interesting to see how they pull that off . <h> 49 Responses to " Voter fraud grifters vs voters , they might have to choose " <p> I hope in all their hubris and flood of money that they never make the connection here . Screw the vote did almost as much for our GOtV efforts as we did and it seems like the media was just starting to admit that the whole thing was a GOP run fraud designed to disenfranchise certain types of people . <p> It will be a shame if Screw the Vote gets its act together but it is a possibility we need to be prepared for . People need to be reminded regularly that the GOP does not really want them to vote and when they get the opportunity as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to subvert the rule of law . <p> I spent four days working to GOTV in central Columbus . In the precincts I worked almost 25 percent of votes cast were forced into the provisional ballot pipeline . <p> Husted and the GOP did everything they could to suppress the vote in Ohio . Rove thought it would work and that 's why he had his Fox News meltdown . And he might have been successful if it was n't for folks like you , Kay , fighting the suppression efforts every step of the way and the targets of that effort voting in overwhelming numbers . I had more than one person tell me that nothing would stop their community from voting . <p> The blowback from the suppression effort won Ohio . Now if we can hold the coalition together for 2014 then we can deliver some payback to the weasels who worked so hard to block the vote . <p> By lying , cheating and stealing as they usually do . ( I hear a lot about conservatives values like honor and integrity , but I rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified conservatives . ' It 's just politics ' as Bush the Younger had it . ) <p> At any rate , the segregationist termites are going to be at it again here soon enough . I say we give them federal ID ( supposedly Shumer and Graham are working on this ) and automatic registration of voters with said ID . ( And we allow insist homeless people to get ID as well , identifying the zip code they reside in if nothing else . ) <p> But we really need to insist on this as a condition of delaying or repealing the defense sequester . <p> max ' We really should just get together a grocery list of stuff we want and offer to extend the Bush tax cuts to Feb. 14 , 2014 in return for said list . Things like statehood for Puerto Rico and the like . ' <p> I do n't think either conservatives in general or the grifters in particular will ease up much because the barriers to voting they are pushing target poor people , who tend to vote Democratic , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time being . They wo n't stop until there is a general revulsion in the population . That might take a while because a lot of people do n't want to hear that America is still not the greatest democracy ever . On the upside , Kay and everyone else who did such a great job in Ohio in this cycle have shown that the grifters can be beaten by hard grassroots work . <p> Speaking of grifters I decided for the heck of it to click on the ad that has been appearing here a lot lately about an " urgent national poll ! " Should Congress give Obama what he wants ? You may want to sit down as what I found will shock you ! Seriously , sit down 8-D <p> The poll is worded in the most inflammatory way possible so I clicked ' yes ' and provided a dead email address . I discovered that 88% of those polled want Congress to stop Obama now ! ( shocking ! ) also a video about horrid government agents coming to take your money ! ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a victim ) . And I had automatically agreed to receive a newsletter ! Lee Bellinger 's executive bulletin Which I bet will have many great offers for gold coins if my guess is right . <p> See ! I told you this would be shocking ! I do wish I could add more exclamation points ! Just to indicate how shocked I was ! <p> edit : I hope BJ gets two cents from this clown for my having clicked the ad <p> I really feel that the True the Vote " movement " was really meant merely to placate and occupy the old geezers on the right -- not the money people but the actual voters and gripers . It served the same function as a seal of approval on a product , or the pictures of Bush as a compassionate conservative hugging black people . The entire thing was put up as a projection and deflection whose goal was to reassure the voters that democratic voter fraud was a real thing and that the GOP was doing something about it that did n't look exactly like voter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Republican politicians would pretend to be less than fully hostile to the good minorities in order to convince the soccer moms that they could vote republican and not be considered racist . I 'm actually kind of surprised that the True the Vote movement , such as it was , ever got to the point of making gestures and feints at being physically present in any particula rpolling place . I think they were just a massive head fake , along the lines of an Andrew Breitbart/O'Keefe video meant to take down the democrats with a tiny investment . <p> It takes a long time . They did n't really have an effective voter protection plan until 2006 ( inspired by the voter ID law of 2005 ) and it 's gotten better every year . Voter protection gets ignored by media , compare the space given to True the Vote ( mostly hype and bluster ) and the space given to voter protection efforts ( real ) which I 've come around to thinking is a good thing for voter protection : ) <p> The claims were outlandish on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's an enormous undertaking . We had +/- 1500 trained in Ohio in 2012 and that took years . Most of ours were returnees , they had done the work before . <p> @ aimai : I ( mostly ) agree . The lack of feet-on-the-ground , the unfamiliarity with and disinterest in the actual rules in Ohio , the media noise , the dog-whistles , all point to a propaganda tactic rather than reality . Doonesbury had the right response , I think , pointing out straightforwardly that this is no more than a revival of our old pal , Mr. Jim Crow . <p> Now if we can hold the coalition together for 2014 then we can deliver some payback to the weasels who worked so hard to block the vote . <p> How exactly is this going to work to win a substantial additional number of House seats in 2014 in an off-year election in most states if we could n't win them in a Presidential year ? Actually , the inverse is true : unless we can hold the coalition together for 2014 , we risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weasels succeed in winning an increment of congressional seats back for team red . The problem is that 2010 enabled team red to win control of enough state houses to do a decade 's worth of structural damage that in most states , we wo n't have a chance to undo until after the 2020 elections . <p> When I vote in elections here in Canada I mark an X on a paper ballot with a pencil . Prior to a federal or provincial election an enumerator comes around to the house and confirms my name and address , no ID is asked for . For some reason , we have been able to avoid the clusterfuck system that has been imposed on US voters . <p> " True the Vote should have spent less time holding conventions where conservative celebrities were paid to appear and more time learning the rules for polling place observers in Ohio and other swing states . " <p> What 's funny is that if the bottom rung of probably decent but misguided poll watchers were to learn how voting actually works , and that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disenfranchisement , they might , might , discover they 'd been lied to by TrueTheVote . <p> Contrast that with the huge volunteer voter protection effort by liberals and Democrats that we 've had in place in Ohio for the last 4 cycles that has operated almost completely under national media radar . <p> Actually , the inverse is true : unless we can hold the coalition together for 2014 , we risk at least a milder version of 2010 in which the weasels succeed in winning an increment of congressional seats back for team red . The problem is that 2010 enabled team red to win control of enough state houses to do a decade 's worth of structural damage that in most states , we wo n't have a chance to undo until after the 2020 elections . <p> This . This is all true . 2014 is going to need a massive GOTV just to hold ground and to try to flip some statewide seats from R to D. It 's going to do diddly squat for taking control of the House . <p> GOTV is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dems can take control at the state level like California has managed this year . Even that will be hard -- the new state districts were just drawn and they 'll make it as bad as the House for gaining ground in state legislatures . But the statewide offices need to be grabbed and held as much as possible between now and 2020 . <p> QFT , not just with regard to Screw the Vote but with regard to everything the GOP does that involves electoral politics . I was heartened by Kay 's and Aimai 's analysis in the previous thread of the structural differences between the Dem and GOP electoral efforts , but there was a lot of overoptimism in that thread -- and I say this as someone who tends to be overoptimistic herself . <p> We can only hope that RW groups like Screw the Vote continue to spend their money and effort unwisely , we can only hope that the GOP never effectively changes its authoritative and organizational campaign structures , and we can only hope that the GOP continues to run candidates who are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that it makes no fucking difference how many billions the Citizens United decision frees up to be poured into ad campaigns supporting them ( and lambasting their opponents ) . And while we hope , we need to remain prepared for not getting what we hope for . The term " it 'll never happen " can not be allowed into our collective vocabulary ( we need look no further than the Romney campaign to see how well that kind of thinking serves its adherents ) . We ca n't take anything for granted . One 2010 was too many as it is . <p> QFT , not just with regard to Screw the Vote but with regard to everything the GOP does that involves electoral politics . I was heartened by Kay 's and Aimai 's analysis in the previous thread of the structural differences between the Dem and GOP electoral efforts , but there was a lot of overoptimism in that thread -- and I say this as someone who tends to be overoptimistic herself . <p> We can only hope that RW groups like Screw the Vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only hope that the GOP never effectively changes its authoritative and organizational campaign structures , and we can only hope that the GOP continues to run candidates who are so flat-out personally repugnant ( cf. Mitt Romney and Joe Walsh ) that it makes no fucking difference how many billions the Citizens United decision frees up to be poured into ad campaigns supporting them ( and lambasting their opponents ) . And while we hope , we need to remain prepared for not getting what we hope for . The term " it 'll never happen " can not be allowed into our collective vocabulary ( we need look no further than the Romney campaign to see how well that kind of thinking serves its adherents ) . We ca n't take anything for granted . One 2010 was too many as it is . <p> @ double nickel : We 'd have that too if we had officials half of whom do n't actually want everyone to vote and a populace where half of them had n't been trained to fear government having any information about them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the GOP top to bottom . Romney 's big GOTV app fails , their pollsters fail , their analysts fail to see the writing on the polling wall , their SuperPAC 's fail , and their supress the vote organizations fail . Add that to their Congressional representatives , who fail at everything , including writing and passing legislation , and you 've got a giant Koch brothers sized mansion on the Great Lake of Fail . <p> I 've never been a republican , but until a decade ago at least you could say they were ruthlessly efficient and competent , even if many of their policies were bunk . Now they do n't even have that . <p> I suspect , and hope , that turnout in 2014 will be pretty good in places like Florida , where racist voter suppression was high . I get the sense that a great many non-whites , particularly , African-Americans here are pretty damn pissed . They 've gone through so much not only to get the right to vote , but to actually exercise the right , that I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another positive note is things are likely to be better in 2014 in terms of jobs and the economy . We 're recovering . In 2010 , so many people who were excited in 2008 stayed home because they had n't received their pony . They did n't grasp the complete shitheap Obama inherited . <p> That 's not to say it will be easy or that the frothing nutters will be any less rabid , but we should have some better things going for us . <p> Of the countless number of words written and broadcast during the past week on the necessity for the Republican party to broaden its constituency , this post is one of the most shrewd and concise arguments I 've encountered illustrating the likely failure of such efforts . <p> Once again , you demonstrate why you are the essential front-pager on this site . <p> I 'm fine with being prepared and rational fears , but I do think we go too far in the other direction sometimes . Part of what the Right does is make a lot of noise and scare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppression . True the Vote did n't have " a million " volunteers . They did n't have " 35,000 " volunteers , either . Those were the numbers they invented and threw around . We had 1500 trained voter protection volunteers in Ohio in 2012 and that has taken us 6 years to develop . They recruited and trained 35,000 people in 6 months ? Bullshit . I do n't believe it . They may have an email list of 35k people , but 35k actual people on the ground ? My ass . These numbers they throw around are meant to scare our voters . <p> I do n't see how the GOP is going to attract more minorities . They are focusing on the Latinos ( completely ignoring African-Americans as usual ) . As a female Asian friend of mine said about republicans . " They offend me on so many levels , as a woman with the rape talk , as a non white with the racism , as a scientist with their disrespect and contempt for education and science " . This friend was very clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on teaching creationism and nonsense about getting rid of PBS . I know it 's a cliche , but Asians do have almost a reverence for education and learning , not exactly republican strong points . In short to appeal to minorities republicans are going to have to become democrats and that is not happening anytime soon . <p> What with teaching , writing , and arranging Balloon Juice meet-ups , where does the man find the time ? But not to worry : I 'm quite certain my opinion is of no consequence to Doug-of-many-nyms . And regardless , the indomitable Kay will keep filing illuminating dispatches from the electoral front-lines . <p> @ Kay : Of course , and like I say , your analysis gives me a happy . But this is what happened this time . Will it happen next time ? Probably , but there will likely be some changes . And the time after that ? Good chance of seeing more changes still . Or these yahoos could just remain this incompetent , or get even more so . I for one do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why I say that the possibility that any or all of these electoral political efforts could improve must be taken seriously , and that none of these groups or strategies can be dismissed outright . I suppose it 's a cliche to say that we must always be vigilant , but it 's true . <p> GOTV is going to be needed -- but it 's needed so that Dems can take control at the state level like California has managed this year . <p> It 's worth pointing out that a lot of the gains for the Democrats this year were the result of a switch from partisan redistricting to a non-partisan citizen 's commission . At the last redistricting , the parties agreed to a terrible ( for the Democrats ) bargain that set up as many safe districts for existing legislators as possible . Once that gerrymander was overturned , we were in position to pick up a bunch of seats just because they were n't designed specifically to protect the R incumbent . If other states can use whatever initiative process they have to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @

##482750 <p> Such a broad and abstract topic as love , not surprisingly , is hard to define . And , of course , many writers , artists , musicians and psychologists have tried . Tons of theories exist and persist . ( Here are four theories of love . ) We spoke with two couples therapists to get their thoughts on this elusive subject . <p> " Being in love is an agreement -- made consciously or unconsciously -- to participate in the experience of personal growth and transformation , " according to Judy Ford , licensed clinical social worker and author of Every Day Love : The Delicate Art of Caring for Each Other . " When we are in love we are saying ' yes ' to the process of becoming our best selves . " <p> Terri Orbuch , psychologist and author of 5 Simple Steps to Take Your Marriage from Good to Great , believes that true love includes both the arousal-producing , **29;2775;TOOLONG passionate love and the supportive and emotionally intimate companionate love . She underscored that both do " wax and wane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decline in excitement is " a typical progression or development of a long-term relationship , " she said . ( Here 's Orbuch 's advice on reigniting the passion in a relationship . ) <h> 6 Signs of Love <p> Orbuch shared six signs that indicate a couple is in love . She said that a couple might have some or all of these signs . ( In other words , if your partner is n't much of a sharer , it does n't mean he 's not in love with you . ) <p> 1 . Personal information . You reveal intimate information to your partner that you do n't tell others , and they do the same . <p> 2 . Mutuality . " You think of yourself as a couple rather than two separate entities or people , " Orbuch said . In other words , you think in " we " terms , not " I. " If someone asks what you 're doing this weekend , you consider your partner in your plans , and respond with something like " We 're not sure yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you both care if the other has a bad day ? Do you automatically turn to your partner for support ? <p> 4 . Interdependence . " You 're interdependent with each other socially , emotionally and financially , " Orbuch said . So whatever you do will affect your partner , and vice versa . If you 're offered a new job in a different city , the decision you make affects your partner . <p> 5 . Commitment . " You have a desire to have the relationship stay , endure and last , " Orbuch said . <p> 6 . Trust . Both partners are honest and have each other 's best interests at heart , she said . <h> Discussing Love with Your Partner <p> People have different ways they express their love . One of the ways you can develop or cultivate love , Orbuch said , is by talking with your partner about it . For instance , an important talk may be your views on commitment . Do you see monogamy as part of commitment ? Do they ? <p> Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , your partner might solely share his private information with you , whereas you tell your close friends everything . This may be upsetting to him , but it does n't mean you love him any less . Or your partner has a medical scare but never comes to you . You think this means he does n't truly trust or love you . However , his notion of love might mean working this out on his own and then coming to you . <h> Cultivating Love Every Day <p> Cultivating love is a lot easier when things are going your way . As Ford said , " It is easy to be loving when the setting is romantic , when you 've got extra jingle in your pocket , when you 're looking good and feeling fine , but when one of you is out of sorts , exhausted , overwhelmed , and distracted , behaving lovingly requires conscious effort . " <p> True love shows up in the tougher moments . " It 's in those moments of restlessness and upheaval that you find out who you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , " Ford said . <p> Below , Ford offers several techniques for cultivating love daily . <p> Do a self-inventory . Sometimes , love can bring out the worst in us , so the last thing we do is behave lovingly toward our partner . When that happens , " Reflect on the interaction between you and your sweetheart . Instead of reacting with a disapproving glance or attitude , reflect on how you might respond lovingly next time . " <p> Work on yourself -- not your partner . According to Ford , " We fall in love with a person who has the qualities that we would like to develop in ourselves . " But instead of developing those traits in ourselves , we " try to develop the other person 's potential . " She suggested not only focusing on yourself but also memorizing this two-pronged principle : " My sweetheart is not me and I can enjoy the differences . " <p> View your relationship as a learning opportunity . " Approach your sweetheart as if you have everything to learn , as if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . " <p> Appreciate your partner every day . " It is easy to acknowledge a surprise grand gesture offered out of the blue , but much harder to appreciate ordinary behavior performed routinely in the midst of the daily grind . If you wait for your honey to do something special before showing appreciation , you 'll be missing a major opportunity to strengthen

##496952 <p> This book is mainly about the treasonable plot to blow up Parliament , by mining through to its lowest floor , or basement , from an adjacent house .

One point of interest to your reviewer is that one of the places where they met , or retreated to when not personally involved in mining , was a house called White Webbs , just on what is now the northern limit of London . This house is now in use as a very nice and popular restaurant , well known to me . It was at the time a disused hunting lodge in Enfield Chase . <p> The discovery of the plot , and the execution of its participants is celebrated every year in Britain , with great displays of fireworks , on a day ( 5th November ) named after one of the plotters , Guy Fawkes . It is interesting to learn so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holt wrote a large number of books with a historical background . This book is the third of a series involving a family from Derwent-water in the north of England . The link with the Gunpowder plot is rather weak , but worth reading if you enjoyed the first two books of the series . On the other hand the majority of the book deals with the plot , and is very well researched , and told in a very plausible manner . <p> As usual with this author you will find that there are a good many footnotes , which we have done our best to make available but not intrusive . There is a great deal of conversation in Elizabethan English , but this will not bother you if you are used to reading the plays of Shakespeare . Finally , there are a few short extracts from contemporary letters , in which the spelling would not pass muster these days , but there were no real standards of spelling in those times . In a very few cases in these letters we have adjusted the spelling to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You may care to make this book into an audiobook , in which case it will take about 12.5 hours to play . We hope you will do this because it will make it much easier for you to enjoy the book . <p> IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN , BY EMILY SARAH HOLT . <p> a way that seemeth right unto a man , but the end thereof are the ways of death . " That is one of the main lessons to be learned from the strange story of the Gunpowder Plot . <p> The narrative here given , so far as its historical portion is concerned , is taken chiefly from original and contemporaneous documents . It has been carefully kept to facts-in themselves more interesting than any fiction-and scarcely a speech or an incident has been admitted , however small , for which authority could not be adduced . <p> Those of my Readers who have made the acquaintance of Lettice Eden , and Joyce Morrell 's Harvest , will meet some old friends in this tale . <p> CHAPTER ONE . THE LAST NIGHT IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope or ghastly Fear ? <p> God knoweth , and not I. <p> Only , o'er both , Love holds her torch aloft , <p> And will , until I die . " <p> " Fiddle-de-dee ! Do give over snuffing and snivelling and sobbing , and tell me if you want your warm petticoat in the saddle-bag . You 'd make a saint for to swear ! " More sobs , and one or two disjointed words , were all that came in answer . The sobbing sister , who was the younger of the pair , wore widow 's mourning , and was seated in a rocking-chair near the window of a small , but very comfortable parlour . Her complexion was pale and sallow , her person rather slightly formed , and her whole appearance that of a frail , weak little woman , who required perpetual care and shielding . The word require has two senses , and it is here used in both . She needed it , and she exacted it . <p> The elder sister , who stood at the parlour door , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was quite a head taller , rosy-cheeked , sturdily-built , and very brisk in her motions . Disjointed though her sister 's words were , she took them up at once . <p> " You 'll have your thrum hat , did you say ? Note 1 . Where 's the good of crying over it ? You 've got ne'er a thing to cry for . " <p> Another little rush of sobs replied , amid which a quick ear could detect the words " unfeeling " and " me a poor widow . " <p> " Unfeeling , marry ! " said the elder sister . " I 'm feeling a whole warm petticoat for you . And tears wo n't ward off either cramp or rheumatism , my dear-do n't think it ; but a warm petticoat may . Will you have it , or no ? " <p> " Oh , as you please ! " was the answer , in a tone which might have suited arrangements for the speaker 's funeral . <p> " Then I please to put it in the saddle-bag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , maid . I can find thee work above in the chamber . " <p> A slight sound behind the screen , at the farther end of the parlour , which sheltered the widow from any draught proceeding from the window , was followed by the appearance of a young girl not hitherto visible . She was just eighteen years of age , and resembled neither of the elder ladies , being handsomer than either of them had ever been , yet not sufficiently so to be termed beautiful . A clear complexion , rosy but not florid , golden-brown hair and plenty of it , dark grey eyes shaded by dark lashes , and a pleasing , good-humoured , not self-conscious expression-this was Lettice , who said in a clear musical voice , " Yes , Aunt , " and stood ready for further orders . <p> As the door shut upon the aunt and niece , the former said , as if to the sister left behind in the parlour- <p> " A poor widow ! Ay , forsooth , poor soul , that you are ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pall that you can not see God 's blue sky through it . Dear heart , but why ever they called her Faith , and me Temperance ! I 've well-nigh as little temperance as she has faith , and neither of them would break a cat 's back . " <p> By this time they were up in the bedchamber ; and Lettice was kept busy folding , pinning , tying up , and smoothing out one garment after another , until at last her aunt said- <p> " Now , Lettice , bring thine own gear , such as thou wilt need till we light at Minster Lovel , for there can we shift our baggage . Thy black beaver hat thou wert best to journey in , for though it be good , ' t is well worn ; and thy grey kirtle and red gown . Bring the blue gown , and the tawny kirtle with the silver aglets tags , spangles pendant , and thy lawn rebatoes , turn-over collar and a couple of kerchiefs , and thy satin hat Thou wert best leave out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my velvet hood , Aunt , and the green kirtle ? " <p> " Nay , I have packed them , not to be fetched out till we reach London . Thou mayest have thy crimson sleeves withal , an ' it list thee . " <p> Lettice fetched the things , and her aunt packed them in one of the great leather trunks , with beautiful neatness . As she smoothed out the blue kirtle , she asked- " Lettice , art thou sorry to be gone ? " <p> " Truly , Aunt , I scarce know , " was the answer . " I am sorry to leave Aunt Milisent and my cousins , and Aunt Frances , " -but Aunt Frances was an evident after-thought- " and I dare say I shall be sorry to leave all the places I know , when the time comes . But then so many of us are going , - you , and Grandmother , and Aunt Edith , and Cousin Aubrey , and Aunt Faith-and there are so many new places to see , that on the whole I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , very like not , child . " <p> " Not now , " said a third voice , softly , and Lettice looked up at another aunt whose presence she had not previously noticed . This was certainly no sister of the two plain women whose acquaintance we have just made . Temperance Murthwaite had outlived her small share of good looks , and Faith 's had long since been washed away in tears ; but Edith Louvaine had been extremely beautiful , and yet was so notwithstanding her forty years . Her hair was dark brown , with a golden gleam when the sun caught it , and her eyes a deep blue , almost violet . Her voice was sweet and quiet-of that type of quietness which hides behind it a reserve of power and feeling . " At eighteen , Lettice , we are not commonly sorry to leave home . Much sorrier at thirty-eight : and at eighty , I think , there is little to leave but graves . " <p> " Ay , but they 're not all dug by the sexton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it lie in the hole she had left for it . " At any rate , the sorest epitaphs are oft invisible save to them that have eyes to see them . " <p> Edith did not answer , and the work went on . At length , suddenly , the question was asked- <p> " Whence came you , Edith ? " <p> " From Mere Lea , whither I have been with Mother and Aubrey , to say farewell . " <p> " Spare poor Faith ! " repeated Temperance , in a sarcastic tone . " Tell you what , Edith Louvaine , -if you 'd think a bit less of sparing her , and she 'd think a bit more of sparing you , it would be 
##502952 <p> Mr. Hollande campaigned on a kinder , gentler , more inclusive France , but his victory over Nicolas Sarkozy was also seen as a challenge to the German-dominated policy of economic austerity in the euro zone , which is suffering from recession and record unemployment . <p> He was sworn in on May 15 . At his inauguration , Mr. Hollande , the seventh president of the Fifth Republic , was accompanied by his partner , Valrie Trierweiler ; they are the first unmarried couple to represent France . Previously , Mr. Hollande was involved with Sgolne Royal , a former Socialist presidential candidate and the mother of his four children . <p> On the day of his investiture , Mr. Hollande named Jean-Marc Ayrault , a longtime ally and Germanophile , as his prime minister . <p> Hours after he was inaugurated , Mr. Hollande flew to Berlin to meet with Germany 's chancellor , Angela Merkel , signaling the importance the new French president places on the relationship between the two countries . But over the next few months he and Mrs. Merkel clashed repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mario Monti , worked to shift the European Union 's focus away from the pure austerity with which it had been trying to solve its economic crisis . <p> Mr. Hollande demanded the renegotiation of a European Union agreement to enshrine debt limits into the law and to punish governments that break mandated limits on annual budget deficits and cumulative debt . In the end , he had to be satisfied with another , parallel and more modest agreement on growth . <p> Budget Built on Tax Hikes <p> In September , Mr. Hollande laid out a budget that would produce the biggest cut in the public deficit in 30 years while raising the top rate for the wealthiest taxpayers to 75 percent . <p> The budget is intended to reduce the annual deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2013 , down from 4.5 percent this year , in line with promises both to Brussels and to the markets . It places heavy emphasis on new revenue , like increased corporate and personal taxes , while freezing total government spending . <p> With the plan , Mr. Hollande @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises of debt reduction , even with lower growth estimates , in order to keep the trust of the market that buys French bonds . <p> He is doing so by raising taxes on corporations , the rich and the middle class and freezing public spending , though not cutting it . Spain and Italy have been under pressure from the markets , being forced to pay interest rates approaching 6 percent , but France has been treated as an exception , paying rates that are closer to Germany 's 1 percent to 2 percent than to Italy 's . <p> French businesses already worried about the competitiveness have complained about the tax increases . And conservative critics have argued that the Socialist government is simply putting off a day of reckoning with a bloated public sector that still accounts for 56 percent of G.D.P . <p> At the time the budget was presented , business and consumer confidence was down , and there was no indication that the crisis has peaked . The economy had had three consecutive quarters of zero growth , which will not be helped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's personal popularity is down sharply in the four months since he narrowly beat Nicolas Sarkozy to become the first French Socialist president since Franois Mitterrand . <p> Mr. Hollande 's problem is that in the middle of the euro crisis and flat growth , with pressure from Brussels and the markets , it is hard to live up to the hopes of his voters for the traditionally Socialist cure of higher public spending . <p> Mr. Hollande 's budget finds the extra $39 billion by raising French taxes still further , upsetting businessmen and the middle class . Some $13 billion will come from new taxes on corporations and another 10 billion from new income taxes , including a new higher rate of 45 percent on incomes over $193,000 and a controversial , largely symbolic and supposedly temporary wealth tax of 75 percent on earnings of over $1.3 million . Those higher taxes , too , have been criticized by business leaders as a large disincentive for talented people to work in France , criticisms echoed by the opposition center-right parties . <p> Under the new budget , normal tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taxed like ordinary income and various tax breaks will be removed , including a limit on the wealth tax . <p> Another $13 billion is to come from a freeze in public spending -- with ministries required to make some cuts to keep the overall state budget the same , adjusting for inflation . Some departments will take a major hit , like Defense , in order to provide more money to keep campaign promises , for example , to hire more teachers and policemen . <p> By this method , Mr. Hollande has argued , France is avoiding austerity and its impact on ordinary people , instead putting the burden on corporations and those who can best afford it But critics like economist Nicolas Baverez have argued that the Socialist government is simply putting off a day of reckoning with a bloated public sector that still accounts for 56 percent of G.D.P . <p> Five Months After Election , Bloom is off the ( Socialist ) Rose <p> The symbol of the French Socialist Party is the rose , but the bloom was off five months after Mr. Hollande @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At the party 's annual congress in Toulouse in October 2012 , there was plenty of fighting among the various factions , and plenty of complaints directed at Mr. Hollande . Some felt that economic rigor had gone too far , and that the government should renege on its promises to European allies and the markets to get the budget deficit this year to 3 percent of gross domestic product . <p> Others said that Mr. Hollande 's decision to meet the target by raising taxes and freezing spending , rather than cutting it , would throw France into recession , even as growth , so far elusive , would by itself provide more tax receipts and jobs . <p> The president was also questioned about his leadership . Mr. Hollande has tried to contrast his style with that of his predecessor , the hyperkinetic Nicolas Sarkozy , but the French , never happy , complain that Mr. Hollande seems somnolent in the face of the economic crisis . <p> Sixty-nine percent of those polled said they were unhappy with the failure to reduce unemployment , which was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal policy . Sixty-eight percent said they thought Mr. Hollande did not know how to show authority , and 63 percent said he could not make difficult decisions . <p> Hollande 's Victory a Rejection of Sarkozy <p> Mr. Sarkozy was the first incumbent president to lose since Valry Giscard d'Estaing lost to Mr. Mitterrand in 1981 . His re-election prospects were weighed down by France 's weak economic condition , but also by public weariness with his hyperenergetic personality . <p> Mr. Sarkozy left behind a France that had ceded economic leadership of the continent to Germany . He and Germany 's chancellor , Angela Merkel , were so close that they were known as Merkozy , but it became increasingly clear that the country with the more robust economy was calling the shots . Mr. Hollande 's victory was in part due to resentment over the austerity policies the pair forced on the rest of Europe and on France as well . <p> But Mr. Sarkozy also left behind a muscular foreign policy , as French troops were dispatched to the Ivory Coast and to the air campaign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters may not like belt-tightening , but both Mr. Hollande and Mr. Sarkozy had promised to balance the budget in the next five years . The vote was viewed domestically as a rejection of the unpopular Mr. Sarkozy and his relentless effort to appeal to the voters of the far right National Front . <p> Mr. Hollande vowed to win changes to a pact tightening the euro zone 's fiscal rules that was pushed through by Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel . <p> Hollande 's Socialists Win Parliamentary Race <p> On June 10 , Mr. Hollande 's Socialist Party and its allies appeared to be on course for a majority in the French National Assembly in the first round of voting for the lower house . <p> On June 17 , in the second round of voting , Mr. Hollande 's party won a solid majority , polling agencies projected , fortifying Mr. Hollande in his push for governments to spend money -- not cut budgets -- to tackle Europe 's economic crisis . <p> Former President Nicolas Sarkozy 's conservatives , who dominated the outgoing National Assembly , suffered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far-right National Front party was on track to win a small but symbolically important presence in parliament for the first time in years . <p> Mr. Hollande is arguing for collectivized debt , or so-called euro bonds , and for the European Central Bank to be able to loan directly to banks and to the European bailout funds . He wants the bank to operate more like the United States Federal Reserve , able to act as a lender of last resort to guarantee the debts of euro zone countries . <p> In response , Ms. Merkel contends that these steps must be a result of a closer political and economic union , not a precursor to it . Shared debt can work only if there is shared decision-making over budgets , taxes and pensions , she says . That is why she is pushing to move ahead with the long-stalled process of European integration . <p> But " more Europe " would mean a considerable loss of French sovereignty over its national budget and the French financial system , an extraordinarily delicate issue for Mr. Hollande and his Socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 . <p> Any moves toward a deeper union within Europe would require constitutional change . And because Mr. Hollande does not have the necessary three-fifths majority in Parliament , he would face a demand for a public referendum . <p> The 75 percent tax proposal , which Parliament plans to take up in September , is ostensibly aimed at bolstering French finances as Europe 's long-running debt crisis intensifies . <p> But because there are relatively few people in France whose income would incur such a tax -- an estimated 7,000 to 30,000 in a country of 65 million -- the gains might contribute but a small fraction of the 33 billion euros in new revenue the government wants to raise in 2013 to help balance the budget . <p> The French finance ministry did not respond to requests for an estimate of the revenue the tax might raise . Though the amount would be low , some analysts note that a tax hit on the rich would provide political cover for painful cuts Mr. Hollande may need to make in social and welfare programs that are likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hollande , a man who wants to lead the left 's battle against austerity politics in the euro zone , promised not only to restore growth but also to revitalize French industry , create jobs and save the French social model -- all while vowing to find $40 billion in savings and tax increases to bring the government deficit down to 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2013 . <p> He even created a whole Ministry for Industrial Recovery , led by Arnaud Montebourg , to stop factories from closing . But now Europe is in recession , and Peugeot , hemorrhaging money , has announced plans to cut spending by $1.85 billion by 2015 , lay off 8,000 workers and shut a major factory at Aulnay-sous-Bois , near Paris . And Mr. Hollande is learning how hard it is to be a French Socialist in a European Union that demands budget cuts and debt limits , endorses free trade and has rules against favoring national manufacturers . <p> After the layoffs were announced in July , Mr. Hollande retorted that the plan " is not acceptable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a foe of globalization and a fierce talker , accused the company of " lies " and " dissimulation , " and called the news " a shock for the nation . " <p> Yet it is not clear what the government can actually do . PSA Peugeot Citron is a private company facing global competition in a cutthroat business with its main market in a recession , and France is an expensive place to make anything , let alone the low-cost cars that make up a large part of its business . Part of the company 's problem , in fact , is that it has tried to keep jobs in France . <p> So far the government 's response , a program aimed at supporting the French car industry as a whole , has been dismissed by critics as feeble . <p> Already , public confidence is waning in Mr. Hollande 's ability to square the circle , even as the economy worsens . France is now at zero growth , joblessness is at a 13-year high , the trade deficit is close to record levels and industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travelers ' Camps Shut Down ; Riots in the North <p> In August 2012 , despite criticism from Roma support groups and leftist politicians , Mr. Hollande 's Socialist government began dismantling illegal travelers ' camps and rounding up Roma from Eastern Europe for repatriation . In doing so , Mr. Hollande was following a policy adopted by his predecessor , Nicolas Sarkozy . <p> On Aug. 9 , police officers shut down Roma encampments in Villeneuve d'Ascq , near the northern city of Lille , leaving homeless about 150 people who had been living in trailers there . The police action against people known in French as " gens du voyage " followed similar raids on camps around Paris and Lyon . A charter plane flew 240 Roma , including children , back to Bucharest , Romania . <p> Interior Minister Manuel Valls insisted that the raids were carried out only after rigorous investigations , saying in a statement that the decision on evictions was often based on sanitary concerns . The presence of the ramshackle camps in working-class neighborhoods , he added , is a well-known source of tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised that the camps would be closed only when alternative housing was available , and Mr. Valls said that officials had been instructed to concentrate on ensuring that families and the most vulnerable had lodging . <p> Mr. Sarkozy 's government was widely condemned in 2010 for expelling Roma , with some critics comparing France 's actions to those of its government in the Nazi occupation years . <p> The law provides for the deportation of people who overstay their visas . Because Bulgaria and Romania are not members of the Schengen agreement , allowing visa-free travel in Europe , citizens of those countries are entitled to a stay of only three months unless they are able to obtain more permanent status , for example , by getting work or education visas . <p> Later in August , there was rioting in the northern city of Amiens . Mr. Hollande said that his Socialist government would do everything necessary to ensure that law and order prevailed . He spoke from a southern town where he had broken his vacation to meet with the family of one of two policewomen killed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 100 youths from a poor district in northern part of the city and up to 150 police officers , who used tear gas and rubber bullets . A nursery school was ransacked and partly burned , as was a community center . <p> The district , Fasset , is one of 15 special urban zones identified by the Hollande government that are supposed to get more policing . <p> A ' Normal Man ' With a Complicated Private Life <p> In the summer of 2012 , the two women in Mr. Hollande 's life -- his current partner , Valrie Trierweiler , a journalist , and his former partner , Sgolne Royal , a Socialist politician the mother of his four children -- found themselves at the center of a wave of coverage that started with a Twitter message . <p> During the legislative campaign in the spring , Ms. Trierweiler , 47 , angered at Mr. Hollande 's public support for Ms. Royal , sent a message effectively endorsing Ms. Royal 's opponent . This was doubly embarrassing because Ms. Royal , 58 , was the official candidate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ms. Royal ended up losing badly , so there was humiliation all around . <p> Mr. Hollande 's amorous life , and his decision to leave Ms. Royal for the younger Ms. Trierweiler , was already well ventilated during his successful presidential campaign . But he is facing a potentially more serious political issue : The apparent intense rivalry between the women -- with Ms. Trierweiler aggressively defending her new position as first partner -- may have a slowly degrading effect on his self-styled image as a " normal man " who is now a " normal president . " <p> Until recently , Ms. Trierweiler was seen as an elegant and strong-willed woman who continued to work as a journalist while supporting her partner . She negotiated a deal with Paris Match to contribute book and art reviews and other cultural coverage a few times a month . <p> The anti-Royal tweet in June changed that perception , and Mr. Hollande made a point , in a television interview on July 14 -- Bastille Day -- of stating that he had told those close to him to keep their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news media . At the same time , Mr. Hollande 's oldest son , Thomas , told friends that the children would now keep their distance from Ms. Trierweiler . <p> France is seeking to inject momentum into an effort to build a viable opposition to hasten the end of a civil war , but the United States has yet to recognize the new alliance as Syrians ' sole representative . <p> France on Tuesday became the first Western country to recognize the coalition , seeking to inject momentum into a broad effort to build a viable and effective

##503651 <h> Is It Legal to Ride in the Back of a Pickup Anymore ? <p> Is it legal to ride in the back of a pickup truck ? To those who grew up outside the nation 's cities and suburbs , bouncing along in the back of a pickup is as much a staple of summer as going to the beach or getting a suntan . But is it legal ? <h> Laws Vary By State <p> It depends on where you are and what you are doing , according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety . Depending on what state you are in , the answer can range from " Sure , why not ? " to " Never ! " The problem is that the back of a pickup is designed for carrying cargo , not passengers . Even moderate vehicle movements can cause ejection of passengers from the back . Yet , in some situations , there is no alternative to carrying passengers other than walking . <h> Legal in 20 States <p> Twenty states have no laws prohibiting riders in the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain substantial rural areas where pickup trucks are needed for work uses . The states are Alabama , Alaska , Arizona , Delaware , Idaho , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Kentucky , Minnesota , Mississippi , Montana , New Hampshire , North Dakota , Oklahoma , South Dakota , Vermont , Washington , West Virginia , and Wyoming . <h> States with Restrictions <p> The remaining 30 states have laws primarily designed for the protection of children . Some of them extend to ages as old as 19 , while a few prohibit any riding in the back . Probably the most lenient is Colorado 's law , which allows back riding as long as the riders are seated and the area is enclosed on all four sides : sorry , but no hanging your feet off the tailgate . Most states restrict this based on age . The following states allow back riders older than age 18 ; Florida , Georgia , Maine ( older than age 19 ) , Michigan , Missouri , Nebraska , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , and Texas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut , Maryland , North Carolina , Ohio , Rhode Island , and Virginia .

If everyone was open to the possibility of new information changing your understanding of the world aorund you , there would be that much less conflict . Change is always inevitable , but even so it is often greatly feared for its potential risks while the possible opportunities are put on a back burner .

Some people instantly think I 'm Buddhist when I tell them I meditate ( I 'm sure a lot of you get that too ) . But I do n't attach myself to any religion . At the same time I try to respect it . Each religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a god .. no matter how different they think the god is from other gods .. no matter what they call it . There 's no denying that it 's all leads to the infinite source . But it 's buried underneath so much ego and separation which is why people are so disconnected from the spiritual aspect of it . Which gives them the illusion of separation and superiority . It 's always " My religion is better than yours . If you do n't believe what I believe you 're going to hell . You 're the devil . Blah blah blah . " It 's insanity . <p> Scientists have been discovering throughout the past few decades how much science and spirituality correlates with each other . Proving it or not proving it is just the cherry on top of our understanding or " being in the knowing " . I believe that science will eventually bring all world religions together . One day . <p> @sisyphus , Technically , the pope does and has changed the Catholic faith . The Church no longer endorses the slave trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the centuries . The problem is that the religion does n't change until one man says so . Even if 90% of Catholics suddenly became pro-choice , it would n't be the official stance of the religion until the pope acknowledged it . The difference is that in Buddhism , there is no hierophant . There 's no one person who speaks for everyone because everyone has their own voice . Hence , if science proved that there is no reincarnation , Buddhists would have to accept this and move on . <p> I like your post alot . I 've always thought that each religion ( in its original , pure form before people started to distort the teachings with egocentric interpretations ) are just different cultural expressions of one spiritual existence that 's really out there . If you have n't you should definetely look into the book The Perennial Philosophy by Aldous Huxley . <p> This whole article is amazing , but this quote really struck me : " It is all too evident that our moral thinking simply has not been able to keep pace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this progress are such that it is no longer adequate to say that the choice of what to do with this knowledge should be left in the hands of individuals . " I think there needs to be ALOT more dialogue about exactly how much scientific " progress " we 're ready for . Technology can do beautiful , amazing things for mankind if used in a healthy &; positive way , but already I think that our technology is way too advanced for our level of maturity as a species . We need to master mroe 
##515052 <p> Talk-show host and racial agitator Al Sharpton 's " stupid ' ' involvement in efforts to put the narrowly divided state Senate back into Democratic hands makes it more likely that four independent Democrats will back the GOP , The Post has learned . <p> What 's more , gloating by United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew that union-financed Senate Democratic victories were a setback for Gov . Cuomo 's reform agenda makes it more likely Cuomo will push independent Dems to keep the GOP in power , sources said . <p> And there was a third and unexpected development over the weekend adding further uncertainty to the Democrats ' hoped-for return to power in January . <p> Sources said state Sen. Malcolm Smith of Queens , who served as the Democratic Senate majority leader in 2009 until he was ousted and then replaced during a bitter " coup ' ' mounted by Republicans and two renegade Democrats , was " open ' ' to helping the GOP keep control of the Senate . <p> Smith , who has talked with Republican leaders about running as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and willing to listen to what the Republicans have to say , ' ' said a source close to the situation . <p> Sharpton , the controversial minister -- associated with racially inflammatory and sometimes anti-Semitic rhetoric -- and MSNBC personality , said late last week he was arranging a meeting in Harlem to encourage the Senate 's long-divided Democrats to unite around one leader to take advantage of several victories in last Tuesday 's voting that could return them to majority control . <p> Sharpton 's efforts and the announcement of a planned Harlem meeting intensified a long-existing racial divide among Senate Democrats , a dozen of whom are African-American , sources said . <p> " How stupid was that ? It was unbelievable , ' ' said a senior Democratic official close to the Senate 's four-member Independent Democratic Conference led by Sen. Jeff Klein of The Bronx . <p> " The last time I checked , Al Sharpton was a paid member of the media , and he 's trying to determine who the next Senate leader is going to be ? That suggests that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to outside influence peddlers like Al Sharpton , ' ' the official continued . <p> Sharpton 's efforts to play power broker also increased the likelihood that Sen.-elect Simcha Felder of Brooklyn , a conservative Democrat and Orthodox Jew who has indicated he could back the Republicans , will align himself with the GOP , a second official said . <p> " Do you think Simcha wants to be anywhere near a group that owes its leadership to Sharpton and all he represents ? ' ' the official continued . <p> Meanwhile , Mulgrew 's concession that the teachers union spent some $3 million opposing Senate Republicans because of their support for education reforms and a less-generous Tier 6 pension plan for new employees was widely seen as an attack on Cuomo , who sponsored both efforts . <p> " Mulgrew 's agenda is a direct challenge to the governor , so how can Cuomo sit by and let a UFT-controlled Senate Democratic majority take over ? He ca n't , ' ' said a source close to the Cuomo administration . <p> The IDC , whose members also include Sens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockland County and David Valesky of Syracuse , was formed early last year to protest what its members said was the dysfunctional and incompetent leadership of the Senate during the previous two years of Democratic control . <p> IDC members have worked closely with the Senate 's GOP leadership since then and have been rewarded with the chairmanships of several committees . <p> The exact number of Senate seats lost by the Republicans in last week 's balloting remains uncertain , but at best , they 'll likely have 31 members -- not counting the four IDC members , Felder and possibly Smith -- in the 63-member body , where 32 votes are needed for a majority . <p> * <p> Bitter state Republicans are blaming longtime Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long for their possible loss of Senate control and for imposing on their party hapless US Senate candidate Wendy Long , who lost to incumbent Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand by a record margin . <p> " It 's time to face the fact of what a disaster Mike Long and the Conservative Party are to the Republicans and to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans .

##518052 <p> The band , self-described as " Midwestern indie rock with a post-punk twist , " will give its last show Saturday night at the Firebird . It 's a show that Orbz singer-songwriter Jason Robinson says will give old fans a chance to reconnect with the group . <p> " We 'll also say farewell to the scene , " he says . " It 's going to end on a positive note . " <p> Over the past year , Robinson says he and band mates Chris Luckett ( drums ) , Jeremy Ivy ( bass ) and Ken Adelman ( guitar ) found themselves playing the same set list over and over . They felt it may be time to end it . <p> " We realized we were n't going anywhere , " Robinson says . <p> Though they were writing new material , none of it sounded like the Orbz , he says . <p> " We kept writing and recording , writing and recording , stuff that was n't good enough to be on the album , " Robinson says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We just became stagnant . " <p> Also , there were creative differences , which Robinson admits often is a clich with musicians , but he says it was true of the Orbz . <p> " We all had an idea of what we wanted to do , and it was all different , " he says . " Everybody wanted to do something , and none of it was congruent with the vision of the band . Everybody wanted to learn different instruments and play different stuff . For me , I always wanted to play guitar , but I did n't feel I had time to devote to it . Now I do . " <p> Also , he says , some members wanted the band to tone down its sound ; others wanted to amp it up . <p> Finally , one night while doing its residency at El Leador , the group decided it was time . <p> " Everyone had to agree before we said a word about it , " Robinson says .

##526250 <p> Beck.com calls this a " four-track recording on a lazy day , " which pretty much says it all . Mario Prietto does the foot-stomping , and Beck plays the banjo . It was recorded at " The Latona House , " whatever that may be . <p> Anyway , the song sounds like it is a rewrite of a Carter Family song entitled " Sad and Lonesome Day , " which has a chorus of <p> Today has been a lonesome day Today has been a lonesome day Today has been a lonesome day And tomorrow 's gon na be the same old way <p> This song was also recorded by Woody Guthrie as " Lonesome Day . " I 'm not sure which track came first , or which one Beck got it from ( though he likely knew both of them ) . His rewrite of the day being " fucked-up , " instead of " lonesome , " is actually quite eloquent when you think about it : taking an older emotion and giving it a more modern twist . It 's much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a song about cowboys hunting buffalo , into " Mexico , " a song about kids working at McDonald 's .

##534052 <h> Study : The ' gateway drug ' is alcohol , not marijuana <p> A study in the August edition of The Journal of School Health finds that the generations old theory of a " gateway drug " effect is in fact accurate for some drug users , but shifts the blame for those addicts ' escalating substance abuse away from marijuana and onto the most pervasive and socially accepted drug in American life : alcohol . <p> Using a nationally representative sample from the University of Michigan 's annual Monitoring the Future survey , the study blasts holes in drug war orthodoxy wide enough to drive a truck through , definitively proving that marijuana use is not the primary indicator of whether a person will move on to more dangerous substances . <p> " By delaying the onset of alcohol initiation , rates of both licit substance abuse like tobacco and illicit substance use like marijuana and other drugs will be positively affected , and they 'll hopefully go down , " study co-author Adam E. Barry , an assistant professor at the University of Florida 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an exclusive interview . <p> While Barry 's study shows evidence that substance abuse behaviors can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy by examining a subject 's drug history , he believes that the persistent and misguided notion of marijuana as the primary gateway to more harmful substances went awry because its creators -- who called it the " Stepping Stone Hypothesis " in the " Reefer Madness " era of the 1930s -- fundamentally misread the data and failed to conduct an adequate follow-up . <p> " Some of these earlier iterations needed to be fleshed out , " Barry said . " That 's why we wanted to study this . The latest form of the gateway theory is that it begins with marijuana and moves on finally to what laypeople often call ' harder drugs . ' As you can see from the findings of our study , it confirmed this gateway hypothesis , but it follows progression from licit substances , specifically alcohol , and moves on to illicit substances . " <p> " So , basically , if we know what someone says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to predict what they respond to with other drugs , " he explained . " Another way to say it is , if we know someone has done the least prevalent drug heroin , then we can assume they have tried all the others . " <p> And while that standardized progression certainly does n't fit every single drug user , the study took that into account too . " There were a low enough number of errors that you are able to accurately predict future substance abuse behavior ... with about 92 percent accuracy , " Barry said . <p> By comparing substance abuse rates between drinkers and non-drinkers , they ultimately found that seniors in high school who had consumed alcohol at least once in their lives " were 13 times more likely to use cigarettes , 16 times more likely to use marijuana and other narcotics , and 13 times more likely to use cocaine . " <p> The study should give pause to anyone involved in youth drug awareness programs , as its findings suggest that making science-based alcohol education a top priority could actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if lawmakers and leading educators decide to use that same science as a foundation for public policy and school curriculum . <p> " I think these results have to do with level of access children have to alcohol , and that alcohol is viewed as less harmful than some of these other substances , " Barry added . <p> That social misconception , largely driven by the sheer popularity of alcohol and the profits it generates for private industry , is diametrically opposed to the most current science available on drug harms . A study published in 2010 in the medical journal Lancet ranked alcohol as the most harmful drug of all , above heroin , crack , meth , cocaine and tobacco . Even more striking : The Lancet study found that harms to others near the user were more than double those of the second most harmful drug , heroin . <p> In its last Youth Risk Behavior Survey , the CDC found ( PDF ) that about 71 percent of American students have had at least one alcoholic beverage in their lifetime , and almost 39 percent reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " This is a time of budget tightening , " Barry concluded . " Many social services are being cut . If you take our findings and apply them to a school health setting , we believe that you are going to get the best bang for your buck by focusing on alcohol .

##535250 <h> May 15 , 2011 <h> Categories : <p> Former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee said on Sunday he " would have made a fine president , " but added that he " was at peace " with his decision not to run for the White House in 2012 . <p> Huckabee also told Chris Wallace of " Fox News Sunday " that he was n't yet prepared to endorse any of the other GOP candidates . <p> " It really came down for me to a very personal , a very intimate , and as I explained last night , a spiritual decision , " Huckabee said during an appearance on Fox , where he has his own show . <p> " You look at the political possibilities - frankly I do n't know that I 'll have a better chance , but I do n't rule anything out for the long-term future , " he said . " But I just somehow believed deep within me that it was n't the right time , it was n't meant to be . " <p> Huckabee , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not seek the Republican presidential nomination , as he did in 2008 . He had been doing well in the polls in Iowa and other early GOP contest states . <p> Asked about his potentially valuable endorsement , Huckabee said he was waiting . <p> " Not immediately , " he explained , saying he was still sorting through his own decision and the emotional aftermath . " There may be a point when I endorse , but right now , I 'll see how the race unfolds and listen carefully . " <p> He offered praise , though , for all the contenders , including former Massachusetts Gov . Mitt Romney . <p> " There 's been a lot of talk about Mitt Romney and me , and we do n't socialize together , we 're not close in personal ways , " Huckabee said . " But I want to make it very clear today - if Mitt Romney is the nominee for our party , I will support him because I believe Mitt Romney would be a better president of the United States than Barack Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will support him if he is our nominee , and he very well may be . " <p> The Republicans have a real problem . They 're looking for someone who can walk and chew gum at the same time and ca n't find them . If Huckabee ran , it would have taken the pressure off Mitch Daniels . Even if the party convinces him to run now , he 's already damaged by the fact that he 's demonstrated so clearly that he does n't want the job . Being bullied , cajoled or threatened into running is n't a great way to convince people to vote for you , and his reluctance would be evident throughout his campaign . If Daniels somehow holds his ground and does n't run , it will likely go to Romney , who will lose the early primaries but prevail in the long run . It 's his turn anyway and we would n't even be having this discussion if the party leadership did n't have to placate the crazy tea party wing , for whom Romney is n't and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans have a real problem . They 're looking for someone who can walk and chew gum at the s May 15 , 2011 at 10:14 AM <p> I am surprised that Huck dropped out . He had a lot of support last time and would 've been a top contender . Poll : Do you think Huck should run ? Link : http : **35;235;TOOLONG ... <p> For the GOP to replace the moron in the white house , they are going to have to come up with someone who IMPASSIONS people , makes them EXCITED , and makes promises he/she will be able to keep . Enough with the types that are currently running - we need to say goodbye to Washington lightweights/sycophants and bring in NEW , FRESH candidates . Not these RINOs that just sit there and let Dems walk over them .

Not these RINOs that just sit there and let Dems walk over them . Let 's get going people ! <p> No question that it was a difficult decision for Governor Huckabee . But there were a number of factors that contributed . First and foremostly , his current platform with Fox News . He is in a strong position to gain influence while he builds his personal wealth . Unlike some of the other candidates , Mike Huckabee did not come from a privileged family . He can use these next two years to set himself up for the rest of his life . There is also the possibility of his running against Mark Pryor for the Arkansas Senate seat in 2014 . Most Republicans figure that would equate to a relatively easy pickup . Then , there is 2016 . He likely figures that Hilary Clinton will be the Democrat 's nominee . He would be up against a foe who would lack Obama 's charisma . Her knowledge and experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running as Senator Huckabee . For now , the GOP has an opening for a true conservative . Four years from now , assuming that they lose in 2012 , this move will create another option for them . <p> I am sorry he is not running . We have such an inept , empty suit , a man lacking moral and spirtual convictions in Obama that for the sake of this great country Obama has to be defeated or children and grandchilden will suffer immensely . Someone has to step up and get rid of someone who never , never shouild have been elected . This commuinity organizer is killing us . <p> Do all these Christian bashers who are making comments realize that Obama is NOW claiming to be a Christian and quoting from the Holy Bible ? SO what makes the Christians on the right worse than the Christians on the left ? .... could it be that they do n't really BELIEVE Obama and can see through his lies and phoney claims ? <p> " Huckabee a Christian conservative " Why does the writer of this news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians out there that are Christian . Is it because he 's a minister ? This is just silly . <p> An empty can of orange juice will be able beat the train wreck at 1600 Penn . Skyrocketing fuel/food and unemployments numbers is what Americans will be focused on toward the end of Owebama 's disastrous tenure . Add to that record foreclosures and bankruptcies and it means one and out for the train wreck . <p> The reason why Mr Huckabee decided not to run if the same reason there is now a cottage industry for all would be republican candidates ..... MONEY . These people have no intrest in making the country better they only have criticism but no solutions . This President is doing a fine job and is an excellent representative and will be elected to a second term as there is no viable candidate that will run against our president . <p> Mr. Huckabee , I survived your tenure as Governor of Arkansas ... barely . I am also at peace with your decision . Like you , I am not ready to endorse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to vote for that disaster Obama either . Could we just skip the presidential race in 2012 ? <p> Huckabee was anything but a FINE governor and nothing has happened to convince anyone other than him that he would have ever been anything other than what he has always been " a corrupt , not very bright evangelical preacher . " <p> Mike Huckabee could not give up the most lucrative career he has ever had . And who could blame him ? He knows he could not win so why give up all his money-making schemes . I knew when he put out his " history lesson " dvds , he was not going to run . Why would he give that up ? Every wingnut in America is going to buy those revisionist screeds . He will make millions . So capitalism claims another one . He knows he is too far right and too religious to win . Good riddance to a possible Theocracy . <p> I read all the liberals comments on Gov.Huckabee . They are so insulting of his Christianity ... but wait ... is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare again his " salvation " ... and that he is a Christian ? ! Hmmm . Oh but wait .. of course ... he 's willing to compromise the Bible .. and his beliefs for the vote ... Oh , I get it ! ! They ca n't find a negative thing in Huck 's past if they dig to China . I 'm guessing he has no terrorist friends ... no ACORN helping with the vote ... no one helping him buy a million dollar home " on a bargain " ... and guess what .. Huck has actually WORKED in life ... prob is n't a great golfer . Yawn .... 2012 coming .... yeah ! <p> The stark difference between President Obama 's faith ( yes , you moronic teahadists he is a Christian ) and Huckentucky is the President does n't wear his religion on his sleeve . Huckentucky is , after all , just another Huckster .

##537552 <h> Spontaneous response to disasters <p> As the after effects of Hurricane Sandy continue to be felt in the North , a new specter -- gasoline rationing -- is making its own unpleasant presence more and more painful for consumers . In the wake of the storm , demand for gasoline has increased dramatically . At the same time , the supply of gas -- especially from powerless local providers and damaged regional suppliers -- has either stagnated or sharply contracted . In response , local governments have rather unwisely attempted to keep prices down by imposing price ceiling and gas rationing boondoggles on the desperate populations . <p> In order to effectively assess such a policy , it 's important to start by recognizing that prices are more than just arbitrary sums paid by buyers to sellers in exchange for trinkets and knick-knacks . A price , within the context of the economy at large , is actually a highly complicated method of communication . It conveys information pertaining not only to the wishes of buyers and sellers , but also to the desirability of goods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production , and the overall efficiency of the allocation of resources in the economy as a whole . A price is capable of discriminating against buyers who are either unwilling or unable to prioritize a good in question and against sellers who are equally unlikely to provide that same good at competitive market rates . Its fluctuations serve as a signal from consumers and producers to entrepreneurs and investors who , should they forecast strongly enough , can alter the structure of production and allocation of certain resources in order to provide for the future demands of the populace . A price plays an integral and yet invisible role in the spontaneous coordination of the seemingly disparate and unrelated phenomena that make up our economy . Like language or the human body , the price system fascinates because it represents spontaneous order on a scale that utterly defies planning and preconceived direction , but that functions splendidly nonetheless . <p> In the case of the gas shortage , then , the rising price of gasoline should be seen in a new light . No longer the instrument of greedy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and downtrodden , the rising price actually signals to buyers that supplies of the good in question are dwindling . As the supply continues to dwindle and the price continues to rise , buyers of gasoline will be increasingly forced to purchase only the amount that they absolutely need . The high price of gasoline will incentivize consumers away from excessive stockpiling , and represents a crucial mechanism of conservation that is endogenous to the price system itself . This , of course , does not guarantee that those who come late to the market will still receive the gasoline they need . It does , however , do a far better job than price controls and rationing -- both of which incentivize excessive stockpiling and black marketeering by artificially attaching pre-disaster " prices " to a post-disaster supply -- at giving them something of a chance . <p> It should be clear -- according to this value-free deductive analysis -- that shortage-induced price increases provide an important mechanism on the part of the unrestricted market for conservation in times of increased scarcity . It is also important to note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so derisively called , sees to an even more critical need . As supplies in affected areas dwindle and prices rise accordingly , entrepreneurs who operate outside of the disaster zone are increasingly incentivized -- in an attempt to capture increased profits from these localized price increases -- to redirect their own resources toward the storm-stricken areas . The inflated prices in these areas , operating again as signals , will draw fresh resources like honey does flies . In so doing , the price increases -- if they are allowed to materialize -- will spontaneously coordinate the replenishment of supplies in these areas by reallocating resources toward them . In short , the much-maligned price increases amplify the willingness of neighboring locales to resupply underserved areas . <p> All of this holds , however , only so long as the voluntary interactions of consenting individuals are allowed to take place free of third-party interference . As soon as exogenous distortions -- in the form here of state intervention -- are permitted to tamper with the price system , the corrective forces of voluntary exchange are immediately undermined . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , the state destroys both the conservation and replenishment mechanisms . In so doing , it virtually guarantees that the pain experienced by consumers will endure longer than is absolutely necessary . It was such an insight that led American economist Murray Rothbard to observe , in 1962 , " The typical government reason for selective price control -- ' we must impose controls on this product as long as it is in short supply ' -- is revealed to be an almost ludicrous error . " The actuality , he explained , is " precisely the reverse : price control creates an artificial shortage of the product , which continues as long as the control is in existence . " <p> The concept is one that , at first , can be difficult to grasp . We are so often presented with portraits of starving families at the mercy of ruthless price gougers that the cries for government to help almost seem to justify themselves . It is for this reason , though , that we must be vigilant against lapsing into the so-called " Nirvana fallacy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fantasy of a perfect outcome rather than the reality of the imperfect state response . In a perfect Eden , for instance , no individual would go for more than a second without all the gas he could ever want . In a market economy , especially one stricken by a natural disaster , he might go for some time without it , but various mechanisms will be in place to provide for conservation , replenishment and bidding for scarce resources amongst consumers . Finally , in the unfortunate state takeover of the disaster zone , he will suffer through the barriers erected against all of these functions , and , moreover , will be made to feel as though he should be grateful for it . <p> I , personally , know how I would rank them . <p> Chris Bassil , Trinity ' 12 , is currently working for Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston , Mass .

##540850 <h> Welcome to How to Take Care of a Turtle <p> Here you can learn all about what it takes to properly care for turtles in this complete owners guide . It 's a guide intended to provide beginners and novice Chelonian owners ( turtles and tortoises ) all the basic information they will need to get started as well as trouble shooting problems that might come up . On this site we cover advice on caring for the following Chelonians : <p> It 's important to know what type of breed you have so you can get the correct information on caring for it . Since not every turtle is from the same geographical location , no two species will have exactly the same care requirements . In fact , turtles are found on almost every continent in dry hot deserts to warm humid climates year around to even areas that have cold harsh winters . All the turtles found around the world have adapted and evolved to survive in their given natural habitat . <h> Things to Consider <p> You should become familiar with all differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . Knowing the answers to these can ensure that your pet stays happy and healthy . Failing to do so can make your turtle miserable which will also more than likely shorten its lifespan . Some of the factors that need to be taken into consideration before you bring one home include but are not limited to the following : <p> What temperatures do your turtle or tortoise need to stay healthy ? <p> How humid or dry does your turtle or tortoise prefer ? <p> Does it require an additional source of water to live in ? <p> What types of food needs to be included in their diet ? <p> How large of a living space is required to ensure a happy pet ? <h> Care Topics Covered <p> Now that you know the questions you need to ask , find the answers to them in the following sections . <h> Setting Up a Proper Habitat <p> You have several options for housing your turtles . Depending on where you live in the country and what type of turtle you have , you can create an outdoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space in the yard . If outside is n't an option or you would like to house your pets inside during a cold winter , you can build an inside table or even house them permanently in a large aquarium if they are small growing species . <h> What to Feed Your Turtle <p> Every turtle and tortoise has a specialized diet that you need to adhere to . Some turtles are strictly vegetarians that only eat greens and veggies while others are mainly carnivores and require proteins or live meals . Simply throwing in a head of iceberg lettuce is no meal for most turtle ; they wo n't get the adequate vitamins or minerals they need to stay healthy . Find out what you should be feeding your turtles . <h> How to Treat and Prevent Illness <p> Turtles like all animals are susceptible to a number of diseases , illnesses or injuries . For starters , the best way to avoid getting a sick turtle is to avoid purchasing one that is n't healthy in the first place . Furthermore , you can help prevent illness by keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its breed as well as feeding it an appropriate diet . Sometime disease and infection are inevitable and unavoidable . <h> Have More Question ? <p> If you have additional questions about your turtle or tortoise , feel free to leave a comment on the page that best describes the type of questions you might have and we will try to answer it to the best of our knowledge . <h> 9 Comments <p> So i live in Northern California and my dad rescued a turtle the other day ( it was about to be ran over i do nt know the species , its a common in ponds and such around here . Anyways I want to release it back into the wild , but i cant until monday , so ill have it for a couple of days . So im wondering how should i take care of it and such ? Should i feed it worms ? I have it in water , with some rocks , but what else should i do for the next 3 days ? <p> Yeah that 's good to keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where it can pull itself out . Make sure it does n't get too cold in the tank . You can probably use some lights to keep the tank warm but not too hot . You can try to feed it worms but it might be too stressed to eat however , turtles can go a long period without eating . It 's good of you to release it since wild turtles do n't do as well in captivity . <p> I found a turtle at my ants house , she lives somewhere close to high mountains and its usually hot in the summer ... I brought it home with me , I live somewhere close to the mountains and yet close to the " Big Cities " Well anyway this turtle I found seems so much like the " tortoise " turtle and I have been feeding it lettuce , the climate is usually warm were I live , The turtle is smaller than the palm of my hand and i 'm only 12 years-old , I need you 're help .. I ca n't find any information that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sometimes likes to walk when it 's not sleeping and it sometime liks to make a little whole when it sleeps .. I do n't know if that 's just for comfort but , i 'm worried that i 'm not taking care of it enough or I do n't know what it likes to play with and i would like to ask if it likes water : s that 's confusing me it dose not drink much water .. Any ideas to help me with everything i have mentioned ? Please Help <p> Box turtles do n't grow very large , no more than seven inches or so . Tortoises on the other hand can grow very large depending on the breed , several feet even . You need to feed it more than lettuce though . Take a look at the section on feeding a turtle . If you keep it inside , take a look at this section on turtle and tortoise tables . To keep a turtle or tortoise happy , you need UV lighting , and a good heat source and humidity if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You should try hard to figure out what type you have first . If you do n't think you can take care of it , you should release it back where you found it . In fact , you as a rule of thumb going forward , you should leave all wild animals where you find them since they will probably live happier lives being free . <p> Is this a new pet turtle or have you had it for awhile ? If you just brought it home and you are first trying to feed it , it might just be that you are not feeding it what it was used to eating at the breeders/pet store . Try mixing up the diet and make it look appetizing . See this post on how to feed turtles . You might also want to look at this post on when turtle wo n't eat . It could be that it 's too cold in your turtle 's tank . If your turtle does n't eat for over a week or so after trying to fix any of these issue , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turtle table instead . Glass aquariums used for box turtles can heat up too much and also , the box turtles will get confused with the glass walls . They might keep trying to walk through the glass . This becomes rather stressful for them . A 20 gallon aquarium is usually okay for your aquatic turtles though but they too might have difficulty with the see through glass sides . If it becomes a problem , you might be able to 
##542651 <h> Global Warming 's Terrifying New Math <h> Three simple numbers that add up to global catastrophe - and that make clear who the real enemy is <p> If the pictures of those towering wildfires in Colorado have n't convinced you , or the size of your AC bill this summer , here are some hard numbers about climate change : June broke or tied 3,215 high-temperature records across the United States . That followed the warmest May on record for the Northern Hemisphere -- the 327th consecutive month in which the temperature of the entire globe exceeded the 20th-century average , the odds of which occurring by simple chance were 3.7 x 10-99 , a number considerably larger than the number of stars in the universe . <p> Meteorologists reported that this spring was the warmest ever recorded for our nation -- in fact , it crushed the old record by so much that it represented the " largest temperature departure from average of any season on record . " The same week , Saudi authorities reported that it had rained in Mecca despite a temperature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . <p> Not that our leaders seemed to notice . Last month the world 's nations , meeting in Rio for the 20th-anniversary reprise of a massive 1992 environmental summit , accomplished nothing . Unlike George H.W. Bush , who flew in for the first conclave , Barack Obama did n't even attend . It was " a ghost of the glad , confident meeting 20 years ago , " the British journalist George Monbiot wrote ; no one paid it much attention , footsteps echoing through the halls " once thronged by multitudes . " Since I wrote one of the first books for a general audience about global warming way back in 1989 , and since I 've spent the intervening decades working ineffectively to slow that warming , I can say with some confidence that we 're losing the fight , badly and quickly -- losing it because , most of all , we remain in denial about the peril that human civilization is in . <p> When we think about global warming at all , the arguments tend to be ideological , theological and economic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just need to do a little math . For the past year , an easy and powerful bit of arithmetical analysis first published by financial analysts in the U.K. has been making the rounds of environmental conferences and journals , but it has n't yet broken through to the larger public . This analysis upends most of the conventional political thinking about climate change . And it allows us to understand our precarious -- our **28;4558;TOOLONG hopeless -- position with three simple numbers . <p> The First Number : 2 Celsius <p> I f the movie had ended in Hollywood fashion , the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009 would have marked the culmination of the global fight to slow a changing climate . The world 's nations had gathered in the December gloom of the Danish capital for what a leading climate economist , Sir Nicholas Stern of Britain , called the " most important gathering since the Second World War , given what is at stake . " As Danish energy minister Connie Hedegaard , who presided over the conference , declared at the time : " This is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before we get a new and better one . If ever . " <p> In the event , of course , we missed it . Copenhagen failed spectacularly . Neither China nor the United States , which between them are responsible for 40 percent of global carbon emissions , was prepared to offer dramatic concessions , and so the conference drifted aimlessly for two weeks until world leaders jetted in for the final day . Amid considerable chaos , President Obama took the lead in drafting a face-saving " Copenhagen Accord " that fooled very few . Its purely voluntary agreements committed no one to anything , and even if countries signaled their intentions to cut carbon emissions , there was no enforcement mechanism . " Copenhagen is a crime scene tonight , " an angry Greenpeace official declared , " with the guilty men and women fleeing to the airport . " Headline writers were equally brutal : COPENHAGEN : THE MUNICH OF OUR TIMES ? asked one . <p> The accord did contain one important number , however . In Paragraph 1 , it formally recognized " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below two degrees Celsius . " And in the very next paragraph , it declared that " we agree that deep cuts in global emissions are required ... so as to hold the increase in global temperature below two degrees Celsius . " By insisting on two degrees -- about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit -- the accord ratified positions taken earlier in 2009 by the G8 , and the so-called Major Economies Forum . It was as conventional as conventional wisdom gets . The number first gained prominence , in fact , at a 1995 climate conference chaired by Angela Merkel , then the German minister of the environment and now the center-right chancellor of the nation . <p> Some context : So far , we 've raised the average temperature of the planet just under 0.8 degrees Celsius , and that has caused far more damage than most scientists expected . ( A third of summer sea ice in the Arctic is gone , the oceans are 30 percent more acidic , and since warm air holds more water vapor than cold , the atmosphere over the oceans is a shocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Given those impacts , in fact , many scientists have come to think that two degrees is far too lenient a target . " Any number much above one degree involves a gamble , " writes Kerry Emanuel of MIT , a leading authority on hurricanes , " and the odds become less and less favorable as the temperature goes up . " Thomas Lovejoy , once the World Bank 's chief biodiversity adviser , puts it like this : " If we 're seeing what we 're seeing today at 0.8 degrees Celsius , two degrees is simply too much . " NASA scientist James Hansen , the planet 's most prominent climatologist , is even blunter : " The target that has been talked about in international negotiations for two degrees of warming is actually a prescription for long-term disaster . " At the Copenhagen summit , a spokesman for small island nations warned that many would not survive a two-degree rise : " Some countries will flat-out disappear . " When delegates from developing nations were warned that two degrees would represent a " suicide pact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " One degree , one Africa . " <p> Despite such well-founded misgivings , political realism bested scientific data , and the world settled on the two-degree target -- indeed , it 's fair to say that it 's the only thing about climate change the world has settled on . All told , 167 countries responsible for more than 87 percent of the world 's carbon emissions have signed on to the Copenhagen Accord , endorsing the two-degree target . Only a few dozen countries have rejected it , including Kuwait , Nicaragua and Venezuela . Even the United Arab Emirates , which makes most of its money exporting oil and gas , signed on . The official position of planet Earth at the moment is that we ca n't raise the temperature more than two degrees Celsius -- it 
##543450 <p> Coming off their bye week , the Arizona Cardinals are looking to snap their five game losing streak on the road against the team with the league 's top record , the Atlanta Falcons . <p> The Falcons ( 8-1 ) are coming off their first loss of the season , a disappointing 31-27 performance against the New Orleans Saints . <p> The poor showing by Atlanta makes a Cardinal victory appear possible . Linebacker Daryl Washington is hopeful that his team can make the Falcons ' loss more than a one-time thing . <p> " Hopefully it can be two consecutive losses , " Washington said . " Hopefully we can go up there and get a win . It is going to be a crazy and hostile environment . " <p> Even though the Cardinals have just one win on the road this season , it came in a nail biter against the New England Patriots . <p> " We can win ( on the east coast ) . Every game is important , every game you can win it or lose it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is just get one win , take it one win at a time . " <p> The Cardinals have not won in Atlanta since 1993 and were thoroughly embarrassed by the Falcons during their last visit in 2008 , a 41-7 blowout . <p> In order to get that win , Washington feels the defense needs to stay true to themselves and execute . <p> " We have to just stay sound in what we are doing with are technique and making plays we know we can make , " Washington said . " That is all you can do as a defense . Go out there and play as hard as you can , use your technique to remove comments which do not conform to these criteria . <p> close <p> 3 <p> messages <p> policy&gt;&gt; <p> 0 <p> 0 <p> " That is all you can do as a defense " <p> FitzIsMyHero ( November 12 , 2012 12:46 pm ) <p> Referring to not worrying if the offense is going to score or if they 're going to score at all HAHA ! If you noticed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATL still put up 27 points ( ON A BAD DAY ) . So , hopefully the defense will be able to give Ryan a bad day and hold him to 27 AND our offense will have a great day and score 28 points . With the bye week and 2 weeks to prepare , I do nt see why the Cards go into ATL and 
##548550 <p> A number of you have been asking me on Facebook , Twitter and iReport about my predictions for the Middle East ten years down the line . <p> I think we 're seeing the beginning of fundamental change in the Middle East . This is the region 's 1989 . The big caveat , however , is that the Middle East is not Eastern Europe . So change will not happen on the scale or with the speed and scope that it happened in Europe . <p> There are going to be much slower transitions . The line forward is going to be much more meandering . Not all countries will be affected . <p> The key places to focus on are the non-oil-producing countries like Egypt , Tunisia and , to a certain extent , Jordan and Morocco . Those are the places where there is significant pressure for economic and political reform . There you ca n't buy off the population easily , which is the typical strategy of the rich oil states . <p> The Middle East governments have used two methods of control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use mass bribery . Countries like Syria use mass repression . <p> I tend to think that the bribery will work better than repression . At the end of the day , Syria is going to have difficulty even though it will probably engage in a pretty brutal crackdown . <p> Years from now my prediction to you is that all those non-oil-producing states will look significantly different from the way they look now . <p> I think with the oil-producing states , change will be more evolutionary . Eventually there will be kinder , gentler monarchies that spread the wealth around more . <p> The really crucial country is going to be Saudi Arabia . I think Saudi Arabia will make it through this period without massive change . It will be evolutionary change and not revolutionary change . <p> If I 'm wrong about that then all bets are off because Saudi Arabia is the 800-pound gorilla . <p> In terms of Egypt : I think it will look like Indonesia today . <p> Ten years ago most people thought Indonesia would n't even exist as a country after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not even a real country - the Dutch had just colonized these 400 different islands . It was poor . It had the dangers of Islamic fundamentalism , extremism and jihadi groups . <p> But the democratic political system stabilized the country . It provided vents and escape valves for some of these tensions . <p> There were hiccups along the way . Indonesia is still a pretty complicated place with a lot of corruption , dysfunction and some problems of Islamic extremism . But , by and large , it has been a stable democratic country with economic reform . <p> I think that 's not a bad model for Egypt and I think if Egypt could get there - which is quite possible - it would be amazing progress for the country . It would be more progress in 10 years than they 've made in 40 years . <p> Those are my thoughts . I 'd love for you to continue the conversation below , and to follow me on Facebook and Twitter . As always , you can send me video questions through iReport . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> I liked it too , but Mr. Fareed forgot to mention one small country , the elephant in the room -- Israel -- which most likely will have a great participation , directly or indirectly , in shaping the Middle East . <p> Elephant ! ! I wonder how Israel will be after bashar el assad falls ? ? That will be a major turning point in the history of the region . The clock is ticking and I am 100 percent sure that the goverment of Israel is crunching the numbers to figure out a solution for this problem ) ) <p> April 22 , 2011 at 4:27 pm <p> vertigovom <p> the elephant in the room -isreal- will most likely suffer from the greatest crisis-holocost- in it 's current history . G luck . ( : <p> April 22 , 2011 at 4:31 pm <p> ziad damaty <p> israil has nothing to do with these its not a middle east its arab reveloution and egypt in 2030 is estamaited to be the 19th on the world it will be much better then indonissia <p> April 22 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your comment ! And it will be even more important to see how the US foreign policy shapes towards Israel on issues like the Golan or colonization in the West Bank . There are two things I found insufficiently were addressed in Mr. Zakaria 's article . First , the relationship between ethics , religion and legal tradition is too important to be discarded . One can not speak of occidental type democracies if the ground is not prepared in advance . Arabic countries rely for instance on the system of confessional fragmentation which is unknown to most Western countries and , from a political persepctive , is egalitarian but difficult to put into place as witnessed in Lebanon . The second big shortcoming in my view is that the author underestimated the geopolitical , historical , strategic importance of Syria for the next decades as well as its valid example of peaceful coexistence between religions . <p> April 22 , 2011 at 4:58 pm <p> Ihab El Attar <p> Very true MapleSyrup . The author seems to be oblivient to the weight of Syria and the outcomes of toppling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised by the superficial nature of this article . I think Fareed Zakharia is not in shape today <p> April 22 , 2011 at 5:11 pm <p> hagar <p> Hey guys I actually think Israel is going to be the least effected country in the region . For starters Israel is an extremely strong , smart , and agile nation . And they know the field and the players better then anyone . More over , these nations will not develop a tolerance for Israel if they become more democratic and can not become more intolerant towards it if they become more radicalized . <p> Israel is the great unifier of the middle east -- the Sunnis hate the Shiites , the Arab Muslims look down at the African Muslims , the Turks and Persian Muslims look down at the Arab Muslims , and so on . The one thing they can all always agree on is that everybody hates Israel and the Jews ! <p> That is the power Israel possesses and can ( and often does ) use in it 's advantage , and this is also the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Israel gets a few more friends in the region due to more open and democratic regims that will be great and they 'll take it , but it is not necessary for their survival and/or way of life . <p> In short , I think Israel is going to be just fine , and I trust in them to maintain their strength , way of life , and regional role no matter the outcome . <p> April 22 , 2011 at 6:19 pm <p> walker <p> I think Mr. Zakaria intentionally left Isreal out of the picture . It is in Isreals best intrest to stay out of the picture . Watch with a mix of trepidation and hope . The real place that Isreal and the rest of the world needs to watch fairly closely is Iran . And that is something I would really like to hear Mr. Zakaria 's opinion on . I think that Iran is a little different than the other countries in the region . In some ways it reminds me more of North Korea . While other countries have maintianed repressive regimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of the opposition and seperated the rest of the world in order reduce the will of the opposition . The Iranian regime has an impunity that no other regime has been able to afford . The closest has been Libiya and you can see how hard it is to change there . If Quadaffi regime can survive this uprising , it will be interesting to see how the offspring in the coming generations do . While the world worries about mission creep and Libiya becoming the next Vietnam , the thing to remember is that Vietnam was a war of world proportions between two ideologies . North Vietnam had the support of the Communist world . Libiya does not have near the intrinsic support . While some countries are strongly against an intervention , they are not inherent allies of Libiya either . My opinion is forget about mission " creep " as that actually makes the problem possible . Instead , it is time for the world to decide what the outcome needs to be and wheather that outcome is worth the cost that will need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stop . If we can not decide to protect the opposition at all costs and take out the regime , we are only postponing the end result and may actually make the problem worse . <p> April 22 , 2011 at 10:33 pm <p> judea4ever <p> " palestinian " common family names : <p> Just like " Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti " born in " tikrit iraq " The family names ( Nisbah ? ? ? ? ) of Arabs who ? ? now occupy ? judea ? reveal their country of origin : " Masri " OR " al-masri " =from Egypt , Hamas member of Parliament in gaza , Mushir al-Masri ( the word " masri " littelery means " the egyption " in arabic ! ) . <p> " There is no " palestinian nation " ! when were there any Palestinians ? ? ?

So , if democracy ( even flowed Indonesian-style ) will take roots in the Arab world , the Israel ( and western civilization in general ) will be in better situation as dispute any anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish rhetorics likehood of a war will go down and situation will be more like in Greek-Turkish Cyprus : both sides ' like to hate ' each-other , but no side wants to go to war ( other things are more pressing -- EU membership , for example ) . So , the ' finals ' can be deferred indefinitely and at the end ( in 100 years -- not that much time for the Old World ) may be even forgotten ( year , I cross my fingers , but not hold my breast - : ) Those are basic ideas behind ' Case for Democracy ' book by Shcharansky ( I do n't thing Shcharansky will claim authorship on ideas , just on presentation - : ) . So , Arab world democratization is a good thing regardless of political views of near-term winers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to loose in it . <p> April 23 , 2011 at 11:50 am <p> anythingGos <p> Sorry for some typos ( ' year ' instead of ' yea ' , etc. ) and one omitted point : Hamas in Gaza is not a democracy . It got power by means of democratic elections , just like Nazis in Germany in 1933 , but it 's not a democracy ( also like Nazis ) . The danger that democratically elected Hamas-like guys will abolish democracy right away is the biggest risk now . I pray to the God ( whatever his name will be ) that it wo n't happen . And I hope he 'll hear me because nowadays Arab world is not exactly Germany of 1933 . And in Gaza Hamas rule is under same pressure from inside as all other dictatorships in the region . I just hope to live long enough to see ( without overstating my ' welcome ' on this Earth - : ) <p> April 23 , 2011 at 12:21 pm <p> ed sr <p> Fareed needs to go back to his brethhren in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill simply looking at him .......... <p> April 24 , 2011 at 1:16 am <p> ed sr <p> Fareed needs to go back to his brethren in the middle east and leave MY country .................. I become ill simply looking at him .......... <p> April 24 , 2011 at 1:16 am <p> Ray <p> Isreal should worry . What we are witnessing in the middle east is a popular uprising of the people against their tyrannical regimes . Although the uprisings are not directed towards Isreal , the people protesting are almost all against Isreal for good reason . I suspect any new governments created and elected by the people are not going to be too friendly towards Isreal . Isreal exists in a tough neighborhood and it is about to get much tougher for them . <p> As for Christians in the middle east . Christians and Muslims live side by side with almost no problems regardless of what the media wants you to believe . With all of the chaos that happened in Egypt , when the police were no where to be found , no security , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian in Egypt , this comes from the Coptic church . All of the incidents against churches came when the Mubarak regime was in full control , then when there was no so called protection from the regime , there was not one incident to date . Makes you think . <p> April 25 , 2011 at 6:07 pm <p> Gil Z <p> Seriously ? ? ? ? Israel has no affect on any of the changes mentioned above . Small player with no real power . <p> May 4 , 2011 at 10:09 am <p> Shalom <p> If they decide to steal more land from their neighbours , maybe . <p> May 23 , 2011 at 5:54 pm <p> Geoffrey <p> In ten years , Israel will not be the Elephant . Let 's face it -- it is n't large and its significance is a creation of its government and of those who love to hate it . I think Israel in ten years ( or it may be called palestine ) will be a democracy with equal justice for Jew and Muslim , going through a process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1960s . The " Law of Return " will be balanced for Palestinians and Jews and not all Jews will be automatically admitted . It will be a very successful economy and essentially a happy place . <p> May 25 , 2011 at 9:10 am <p> Felix1877 <p> Maybe it 's a Jewish dream but there are a lot of actors in that issue and ' Happy Palestine ' dream is the most difficult one to accomplish . <p> May 26 , 2011 at 2:53 pm <p> Ya Ya <p> I agree that he did not mention the big elephant . Although i love to watch Fareed 's show , but this time i have to disagree with his intake . The Middleeast today reminds of the Middleeast in early fifties . Lots of coups and lots of political parties taking shape . The only thing though , at that time , the West was very much involved of what was going on and the Arab population was half a sleep . Today , the Arab population is awake and Israel which did not kind of exist in the fifties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jewish state , is kind of a stone in the shoes today and i believe that what is going to push the Arab population toward more radical Islam . I think the United States political power in the Middleeast is in decline and to be honest , the one who controls the Middleeast , its oil and natural gas is the new super power . The United States is not playing an honest broker in the Middleast when it comes to Israel and is not being honest at all when it comes to Saudi Arabia . Those 2 countries are going to hurt the U.S politically and remember , the Middleeast is very much like its desert , quicksand , once you are in , its not that easy to get out . <p> May 30 , 2011 at 11:56 am <p> Al Americani <p> Jesus Wingman .. you should be riding the nuke . <p> June 12 , 2011 at 2:56 pm <p> vertigovom <p> in ten years egypt and much of the muslim world shall be ruled by strict sharea law and i hve the feeling you already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt the power of freedom !

Where Fareed fails in his analysis is a country like Indonesia today where minorities barely have the right to exist , is better than an Egypt under Mubarak . Sharia law will come to Egypt and they will have another Iran/indonesia/saudi arabi whatever you want to call it BUT IT WONT BE BETTER . <p> April 22 , 2011 at 8:10 pm <p> Amanda <p> You 're right , almost that is . I mean if the new law is called Sharia , it wont be what you think . That 's because you got no clue that Sharia ( Islamic law ) is not static . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Trump will destroy the Middle East , Israel included , in a nuclear holocaust , the likes of which could never even be imagined if you considered it for a thousand years . TRUMP/PALIN ALL THE WAY IN THE USA 2012 ! ! <p> April 24 , 2011 at 12:24 am <p> egyptianchick <p> For those of you saying that " sharia law " will creep into egypt . <p> point of information : sharia law already exists in egypt . nothing new . anything related to family matters is dealer in terms of sharia law if you are of muslim faith . <p> can we talk about another boogie man . this one is getting old . <p> April 25 , 2011 at 12:11 am <p> Geoffrey <p> Nobody with knowledge of the region of the culture " Knows this " ... in fact nobody thinks it is true . <p> You obviously do n't know what Sharia law is . It is actually very similar to Jewish Halacha ... almost point for point . It is similar in concept to Catholic canon law . It is most definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the added components that repressive regimes have added , claiming that they are following religious laws when they are not . <p> You need to study this more because your knowledge is zero and your speculation that an expert such as Mr. Zakaria " Knows " what you think you know , but do n't is extreme arrogance and , quite frankly , stupidity . <p> May 25 , 2011 at 9:14 am <p> Bill Constantine <p> I agree with the answers from the people that just offered their opinion .... Convert to Christianity and you die ? Is that correct and did this happen ... The Mosque and State should be seperated ... Two prayers a day only .. one in the morning and one at night .. Put me on your TV show so I can offer my opinion ... not the same people whos brain we have picked for years ... Bill the Greek .. I am afraid that Fareed Zakaia is afraid like the Al TV station to come out with any statement and to how it should be done there ... He is afraid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me saying " give something up for lent every other year " . You cant go and change peoples religions , the religion says pray five times a day and if they choose to let them . Not two times a day . Thats just stupid <p> April 22 , 2011 at 11:39 pm <p> FRANK OLIVER <p> Theo only Shiites all over the world only following those moderate practices as you told . <p> April 23 , 2011 at 5:01 am <p> Geoffrey <p> Mr. Constantine -- you have no clue and need to broaden your knowledge of Egypt and of the middle east . The truth is that there have been Christians in Egypt longer than in Europe and they are still alive . Yes , there are occasional riots and outbursts but those who govern have always , since the time of Jesus , have protected the Christians . In fact , Islam has specific rules about protecting Christians which have generally been followed by its leaders . <p> So stop listening to professional islamophobes such as Robert Spencer or Faux news . The information you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US . <p> May 25 , 2011 at 9:21 am <p> Roelof Kenth Gort <p> Fundamental change ? ? Indonesia , where they did n't want to shake the US first Ladies hand , where they stone people , even want to behead a Christian , because the prison does n't due critizising Islam . Indonesia , where they slaughter Christians . That 's fundamental change ? ? So Libya is going to be the same way as Egypt . Egypt were they lately burned a Copt Church and Christians their houses , because of their faith . That 's what Egyptians call revolution and the west calls democracy . We should nuke them . For instance look at Japan . Indonesia a country that tries to do the same as Iran . Build nuclear facilities , while their neighbour country Japan ( more and most efficint country in the region ) just got hit by a tsunami . Indonesia ( country with 200 million muslims ) want to make a nuclear bomb . Islam is dictatorship . That always means war . Islamic countries having a nuclear bomb is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on us , we fire 100 back . Or we fire one on them , they fire one back , we fire 200 on them . <p> while you mentioned bout .. " Egypt were they lately burned a Copt Church and Christians their houses , because of their faith . ' do you care to find out how the Christians protected the Muslims during the Friday prayer in the midst of the protests . Now , don ; t even try think to twist what I just said to make it look like the Christians were turning the other cheek while in reality , what it meant was that among the civilians , there is no beef between the Christians and the Muslims . <p> April 23 , 2011 at 10:31 pm <p> egyptianchick <p> today muslims protected christian easter services in egypt . christians protected muslims worshipping on friday . there is more " protection " and unity than there is fighting . egypt is NOT a secretarian state . And yes there are idiots that would like it to be so , but the majority of egyptians are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for THOUSANDS of years . Foreign infiltrations from Saudi arabia and elsewhere like to mess up our social fabric , but this is NOT in an Egyptian 's nature . Egyptians just have to remember our history and know that we are one people . A 200 year old country will not teach a 9000 year old civilization how to exist . thank u very much . We might have some bumps ... but we will make it out , just like we have time and time again . <p> April 25 , 2011 at 12:18 am <p> Geoffrey <p> If this subject interests you so much ... learn about it . Absolutely nothing that you said " Mr. Gort " is true or based on real fact or understanding of Islam . <p> May 25 , 2011 at 9:23 am <p> Dummy <p> I think , all Middle-Eastern governments follow India , the most corruption nation on the earth . <p> Dummy .... your name sounds just like your thoughts ..... dumb ! What has India got to do with this ? Agreed there is corruption in India but every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mind you India will be the top 3 economies in the world in 20 years . <p> April 22 , 2011 at 11:12 pm <p> mist ryder <p> @Dummy Dump-&gt;seriously dude .. u need help ( mentally ) <p> April 23 , 2011 at 12:51 am <p> Hohenzollern <p> How did you arrive at this conclusion ( That all countries in the Middle East follow India ? ) There are many Middle Eastern countries that follow Saudi Arabia . Especially those who are members of the GCC . There are other Middle Eastern countries that perhaps follow Iran . The rest just attend to their own needs , and do not follow anyone . And Gaddafi is someone who is insane <p> Also , India is not in the Middle East . <p> April 23 , 2011 at 12:56 am <p> lokiman301 <p> The reason that they follow India is not for the corruption , but for Indias Democratic and mostly Hindu culture . These are the things that Muslims want and love .... lol .... NOT ! <p> April 24 , 2011 at 3:58 pm <p> Jeff <p> I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The Stranger , " by Albert Camu . <p> Farheed , You mention the development of kinder and gentler monarchies . What about the one country that is now ruled by a theocratic government , Iran ? What do you predict for the future of that country ? <p> Exactly ! ! ! At least someone here knows what he s talking about . What about Iran Mr. Zakaria ? U went all the way to monocco but forgot one of the main players ... Iran will be as big of a player as Saudi will . Oh by the way Mr. Zakaria . I personally think ur a liberal trying to hate on donald trump and every other republican . Just do me a favor . Go live in a cave somewhere in monocco ( ur favorite country ) and let history play everything out <p> April 24 , 2011 at 3:40 am <p> Ken <p> Thank you President Bush for initiating change in the middle east . History will be accurate even if ideologues of today are blinded by their foolishness . <p> I would disagree about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations such as Nigeria , despite their acceptance of bribes , are plagued with cruel , tyrannical governments and extreme environmental/ethical malpractice . The assassination of activist writer Saro-Wiwa is a great example of how crucial change must occur in oil-producing nations . Also , recent environmental disasters such as the deep horizon oil spill , mega storms , and high cancer rates will precipitate a more rapid change in those countries as a result of growing public uprest . <p> Good visions of the future . What about the fringe groups .. Hamas &; Hezbellah ? ... I do n't think they 'll sit back &; let themselves be displaced by freedom of choice . Sad that Syria is such a basket case .. I hope the people rise up , destroy the Army &; let a new day begin for them . I wish the whole region the best . <p> The same thing will happen to them as happened to the IRA in Ireland and to the Irgun . They , or rather their members , will become part of the political process . The Irgun was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestine so it could become Israel . The Irgun lobbed home made rockets , blew up hotels with women and children in them , used truck bombs disguised as ordinary farmers trucks , assasinated and so on . In short , Hamas is no different . Netanyahus Likud party is a direct political descendant of the Irgun . <p> In time , these organizations always run out of steam as their constituents find a political voice . <p> " I think with the oil-producing states , change will be more evolutionary . Eventually there will be kinder , gentler monarchies that spread the wealth around more . " Did you not read this guys article ? He is a avid socialist . <p> Fareed , Your vision of the ME in a decade is good , but missing is how will this effect any agreement with Israel by all the Arab nations to resolve the Palestinian question . W/O that , nothing will be settled and the hate and semi-war will go on . Do you see this being resolved in 10 years ? <p> This is because over 85% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland/Germany ) . They emigrated there from Khazaria ( southern Russia ) about 7-800 BC . The Khazars adopted Judaism , and are not Semitic by blood . They originally spoke German/Yiddish before occupying Palestine ( a region even their great , great , great , great grandparents never lived in ) . Birobidzhan was actually the first true modern Jewish state -- not the stolen , bloody land of the Isra-LIES . <p> Obviously the middle east -- the so called " Arab Spring " is transforming the region for better or worse . But who is really responsible for this ' Grand Design ' ? After the oil revolution , the whole region 's economy lifted the standard of living beyond pre world wars ...... the current Arabs sits on the same table as the western allies and dictates the price of oil &; gas ... is this over ? instead of the national flags , is the western multinational and corporation flags flutter in the middle east ? The Arabs should unite democratically and must ensure its continuity before its too late ............. PKM <p> Remember for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ returns -- this is what Christians and Muslims believe . Jews on the other hand are still waiting for Christ to come . When the Anti-Christ comes , Jews will think he is actually Jesus Christ ( upon him peace ) -- since he will be almost a perfect imposter . He will come in a time , when right seems wrong , and wrong seems right . This sounds like now . Nowadays , NOT having pre-marrital sex is taboo , when it used to be an outrage . <p> Forcasting has to be difficult as each country has it 's own unique circumstances , leaders , mix of ethnicities , religious mix . I hope the Earth will be a better place in a few years when this settles out . I have a related question ; How will Wikileaks and Bradley Manning be viewd in 20 years ? I recall the brutal crowd at the Berlin wall concert booing Sinead O'Connor off the stage because she accused the church . Now , we all unfortunately are aware that she was totally correct in her facts , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization with much more respect ? <p> To Fareed , It seems that one of the central hubs around which America 's involvement in Afghanistan revolves is the relationship between Pakistan and India . The two have fought wars against each other and there are still border disputes that create an incredible cultural tension between the two countries . We clearly see that Pakistan is somewhat dragging its heels in going after Taliban members that have moved into their country in part to augment its military presence along the Pakistan-India border . If the President of the United States asked you for a proposal to ease some of the bad blood between India and Pakistan and get them to work together on this issue , what steps would you describe to move in that direction and how would you implement it ? <p> Fareed Zakaria may be Indian-born , but he is a Muslim . Hence , like all Muslims , he will put his religion first before any loyalty to the country of his birth , citizenship or the U.S. where he now lives ! Make no mistake about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ max <p> Agree . Fareed comes across as a classic Indian who does not believe in the concept of British India partition . His analysis of Pakistan is arguably laughable and his world views are invariably through prism of Indian secularism . Its just a very fluid situation in the Middle East . Only time will tell how and where the chips fall in the coming decade . In subtle ways all of us including Fareed have our own analytic slant . <p> April 23 , 2011 at 1:04 am <p> Geoffrey <p> So you think that someones nationality disqualifies them from knowledge of other countries ? for example -- yourself ? <p> Dr. Zakaria is a widely respected expert on the Middle East with a PHD from Harvard in economics and political science . Hardly a moron . You ? What are your qualifications ? Probably 0 . <p> May 25 , 2011 at 9:34 am <p> Xugos <p> Juan , you 're a moron , not Fareed . I am of Pakistani/Indian heritage , and I have a few relatives over in Pakistan , and all of them appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is an EXPERT on India-Pakistan relations . <p> What are you . Fareed 's bitch ? He is as biased against Pakistan as Rep. king is against Muslims . Get your head out of sand or his @$$ . <p> April 23 , 2011 at 11:32 am <p> Sofia <p> Economics are the critical underlying force ... the gap between haves and have-nots is increasing . Population is also rising ... the percentage of young population under age 25 within all these ocuntries is high ... unemployment high , costs rising , food and water and electricity shortages .... the list goes on ... all issues must be solved in order to create a more secure future . It may seem like it 's religion .... but it 's not the only influence . <p> Imagine not being able to support the family ; imagine not having an education system , imagine not having an industrialized country that offers jobs for your population . Then imagine watching these mega-rich groups , driving by in their luxury cars , going to their mega-million mansions , flying all over th eglobe .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .... they do n't even acknowledge you exist . What do you expect the reaction will be ? Until it is solved , the backlashes will continue . <p> We 're arguing over such trivial things in the USA because most of us writing on blogs have a great life . It might take much longer than 10 years to solve issues in parts of the world where the problems are so ingrained and run so deep within the culture and economy .... it could take more like 70-100 years and a few more generations before it can emerge as stable . By then , though , oil supplies may drastically change globally , and a new set of problems will appear . America will also face similar challenges .... economy , energy , growth , internal wealth .... haves and have-nots ... these are global issues that are n't going away no matter how much they are ignored . <p> April 25 , 2011 at 6:33 pm <p> Sujoy Gupta <p> That is a myth propagated by the Pakistani military leadership as a ruse to not have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason the Pakistani army is not going after the militants is so that they can bring them back into play for what they think is their strategic depth as soon as Washington gets sick of the Afghanistan quagmires and leaves . <p> The India and Pakistan can not work together in any practical manner until the issue of Kashmir is settled once and for all . They need to split Kashmir and divide it up or free the people of Kashmir in a free nation to settle this issue . This is similar to Israel occupying the illegal territory which is a sole major issue of the middle east . I see more trouble and more wars through out the middle east and other parts of the world in the next 10 years with devastating consequences . We should concentrate in producing more energy at home or we will be messed up economically and may have to file for bankruptcy that will be our complete downfall and crippled nation by the energy producers control by the middle east . Where are the brains of United States ? We had control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead to look forward . We need to get our house in order instead of policing the world . <p> Hi , kashmir can not be resolved without bangaladesh becomming pakistan again . Lets ask bangladesi if they are intrested . This discussion between india &; pakistan is useless . The same race is fighting among themselve and other races are playing . This middle-east discussion can not have south east in it dumbooos <p> April 23 , 2011 at 3:48 am <p> Romia <p> So true ... we should mind our own business and house of lies before tending to others ' <p> April 24 , 2011 at 2:43 am <p> Amit-Atlanta-USA <p> Friends : <p> If you are TRULY interested in contributing to the Af-Pak ( incl. negotiating withe Taliban , drone strikes etc. ) , and Indo-Pak discussions there 's a lot going on right here on CNN-GPS . <p> Dude , no one gives a jack about your useless RESP that is below somewhere so try to that pie-hole shut . Better yet , go back to India , Atlanta is way too first world for yaaa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ansori Nawawi <p> Am wondering how you got the idea that ten years ago " most people thought that Indonesia would n't even exist as a country " You obviously listened to a very select group of people . Anyway , there is a significant difference between Indonesia and Egypt ; the former is rich in natural resources , including oil and gas . But the Egyptians are much more well-educated now than Indonesians ten years ago or even now , although Egyptians are also much much more class-stratified . Nevertheless , I join you in wishing that Egypt will be at least as stable and prosperous as Indonesia ten years from now . Muslims need more Malaysias and Turkeys . <p> Nawawi .............. your concern are good.Now Malaysia is better than Indonesia in several issues . But what Fareed Zakaria mean was the conflict . Indonesia and Egypt had dictated for over 30 years . If you think that Indonesia , Malaysia or Turkey as a Muslim country . I think we all wrong . They are not . They are simply a secular country with majority of Muslims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last millennium -- famine led to insurrections in many parts of the country . On top of which the separatist movement in East Timor , which got its independence in 2001 . So Fareed was not wrong , when he described the situation in Indoneisa some 10 years ago . <p> What haunts me is the spectre of a Middle East dominated by the US , Great Britain and France . Unless the people of the Middle East get together and stand up for themselves , that 's what precisely will take place and Islam itself may start to become a thing of the past . At that point , these people will cease to chant " Allah Akbar " and start to chant " Allah Akbar , but Capitalism , Akbar-er " . <p> Yeah ......... you probably right ................ all of the prophets and religion from Islam , Christian and Jews were there .............. but seems has nothing change ............ just wait for Jesus or prophet Isa to show up . <p> Jack , you got it wrong , Fareed meant Egypt , when he compared it with Indoneisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a strong military in the background , yet a secular , islamic ruling party that governs . It would focus primarily on its political stability and economic growth . The Israeli-Palestinian issue would not be on top of their agend of foreign politics . <p> Egypt and Iran will resume diplomatic ties . A week after Mubarak stepped down , two iranian warhsips got the permission on Feb. 18 to pass through the Suez on their way to Syria . The U.S. and Israel fear a change of wind in foreign policy in the post-Mubarak Egypt . The ruling elite will focus more on the Arab world , have more sympathy towards the Palestinians and distance itself from the West . <p> April 24 , 2011 at 4:03 am <p> Amit-Atlanta-USA <p> I believe that too , UNLESS Muslims adapt and join the revolutions sweeping the free world ( Tech , Education , Freedom , Tolerance etc. ) , they may never see true progress , and all these movements may remain mere aberrations ! <p> prediction is tough especially about specific countries , it 's all fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendencies any attempts at greater freedom and share of wealth will be violent and ugly , I am surprised and pleased by what is going on in the mid east/north africa , I realize I wo n't see a free and equal world in my life but it seems we are at least heading in the right direction no matter how slow . I suspect in the short run the mid east will not achieve these things until they get out from under the yoke of institutionalized islam tho it indeed looks like some changes are coming soon <p> Give me a single example of ' institutionalized Islam ' in a country ? There is n't any .. If you are thinking of Saudi Arabia , then for your information , the entire premise is wrong . First , there is no concept of " monarchy " in Islam and likewise no country fits the bill of an ' Islamic State ' . <p> Do you see Turkey being influential in the Middle East ? If they do become part of the European will that change their political stance in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer to peace in the Middle East . <p> You mean Turkey already tried to unite us into somthing stronger but got stabbed in the back by the Arabs , do nt you ? <p> April 23 , 2011 at 4:56 pm <p> Mike <p> Mr. Fareed Zakaria is completley wrong . Israel was not even metnioned , it is the 800 pounds guriella and that is where things will be decided , The arab poeple are not happy and do not like israel the way it treats the Palestinians . Are you Mr. Fareed afraid to criticize israel so you will not be fired from your job . I think you are a coward . <p> e , Israel has done some bad things , but its population is only 7 million . They do nt even have diplomcatic relations with most Arab countries . They are an inconsequential part of the change that is occurring for 50 million Arabs in these other countries . Stop blaming everything on Israel , and start blaming the domestic corruption within these countries themselves . You clearly have an irrational bias against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billions in aid to this region , and our billions are , in fact , the 800-pound gorilla . We give Israel billions , and other countries billions to protect Israel . To deny this is to deny reality . To call what they 've done " some bad things " is to ignore the atrocities they committ every day ; to call them " inconsequential " is to recognize what Israel should be , and would be without US funds . <p> Iam egyptien and muslem ..... and i tell u " do n't be worry abt chrestians there " they r like our brothers ... in days of revolution in square they were protecting us during our pray .. and vice verca <p> As an Egyptian , I have to say that your article kind of disappoints me . Do not see any grounds for comparing Egypt to indonesia . It is quite far fetched in my mind . I 've been thinking deeply about how Egypt would progress . Indonesia in the middle of the ocean in a very different continent and very different culture and ethnicity came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a line similar to that of the islands ? Is n't this quite far fetched ? ? Indonesia is a great nation for sure.Have you visited Egypt ? Have you seen Egyptians in the streets of Alexandria and Egypt ? I really hope that Egyptians will make it in less than 10 years to a great status with no corruption . Egypt is booming with ideas and hopes . Living in the west for the past 7 years i really sense what is potent inside the Egyptian identity . <p> Looks like you 're not watching the news . it took 18 days to topple the pharoah in a very elegant and soft way . The experience of a nation like Egypt transcends generations . Please visit Egypt.I invite you <p> Regards <p> April 22 , 2011 at 5:14 pm <p> MapleSyrupMan <p> Mr. Ihab , thank you for your kind reply to my comment .

How many people know that in Arabic tribal systems , tribe chiefs had a role of judge , concilator for family affairs and social moderator more than 1000 years before Scandinavian countries discovered it ? I have had the chance to teach private international law for a few years and use it in my legal practice for more than 20 years , I can confidently say that the system of legal and confessional fragmentation is a very advanced system from a legal and social point of view . Having visited countries like Egypt , Syria and Jordan for the last 20 years , I am astonished at how little these systems are known to foreigners . Syria has a story that goes back more than 6000 years and has a lot to offer for the region 's peaceful and harmonious future so has Egypt . All the best wishes from a Canadian/Greek national . <p> i sincerely hope Egypt excel faster than Indonesia , but because of your geographical location and foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what Indonesia have done in the past ten years . <p> 1 . more than 30 years of a corrupted system which means makes a DNA modification happened in Egyptian people ! ! ! 2 . West interest to maintain Egypt weak by either divide and conquer as Egypt has many ethnics and many religious parties . 3. the excellent investment done by Mubarak in education which left huge number of people illiterate and easily mobilizable for influential people with hidden self interest . <p> I wish that Egypt remains as one country , and retrieves it 's old legacy " 19 's " <p> One of the greatest problem facing Egypt is the large increase in the population . In 1979 , the population was about 40 million and Egypt was able to feed itself . The current population is about 80 million and Egypt has to import large amounts of food . Part of the reason for the current revolution in Egypt was about feeding the population in the country . Since Egypt is not an oil exporter like Saudi Arabia , the growing population is the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an estimated 32% of the population is under 14 years of age . See https : **34;6582;TOOLONG ... . Egypt 's problems will not go away no matter who is running the country . <p> I second that . But because relativism makes it almost impossible to judge a situation a gauge is needed . And here it was the western gauge for sure . Far too many people assume that all the peoples of the world want a democracy at home . I 'm from UAE and ( in my western-educated-mind ) I find it unfortunate that most UAE nationals are really not interested in having say on virtually any matters of national interest . You can exclude the professors , the western educated and those who spend their day on social networks/media . The average Ahmed is too busy pi*pin ' his ride ! <p> @Allocer , really ? its safe to conclude that . I 'm not even American but I have to reply and say your comment smacks of ignorance . How do I explain this to you ... it 's kind of like calling your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that idiot comment . <p> April 23 , 2011 at 4:14 am <p> gok <p> The " turn them into a glass parking lot " statement is the standard horse manure you get from bored unoriginal morally dysfunctional American youths . <p> Ihab &; fareed I do not think there is any hope for middle east as long as your undetstanding of freedom is killing people who are different from you and demonstrating every day for nothing.please go back to work ! ! <p> The American Foreign policy towards middle east and west Asia for past five years " follow the western pattern of democracy and freedom in the middle east , west Asia otherwise live as Talibaens and die " <p> It is interesting to me that you do n't mention Israel in your predictions . Why is that ? Whatever anyone thinks of Israel , they can not easily deny Israel 's contributions to science , medicine , technology and the arts . Hopefully the region will join in pursuit of peace and advancement of human endeavors , living together in peace . <p> That 's kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fed many dictator 's bellies in the region . If they were n't so busy colonizing Palestine , perhaps dictators would not be able to use the justified outrage of the people , against Israel , to stay in power so long . <p> No such thing as a Palestinian . Israel gave the Sinai back to Egypt and they made peace . Israel gave Gaza back to the PLO and got rockets in return . The " So called " Palestinians should return to thier original countrys .... Syria , Jordan , Lebanon , Egypt . <p> June 6 , 2011 at 12:57 pm <p> NutellaFerrero <p> What about the 740+ vetos of the US before the UNSC to condemn Israel 's illegal actions ? Resolving the restitution of the Golan heights and the Palestinian problem may be of more importance . Cheers . <p> Perhaps had the arabs not attacked Israel in 1967 and 1973 plus the intafadas , the Israelis would not be in the Territories . Face it , you lost two plus wars and do not want to pay the piper . Man up or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 7:06 pm <p> Luis Mario Arismendi <p> I agree with the views of NutellaFerrero . E. Howard can not seriously be writing this . Isreal 's illegal colonization is the real problem since it is aimed at depriving Palestinians from human dignity and their right to form a viable State . Sadly , this builds upon another important issue such the refusal to restitute the Golan heights to Syria . Pre-1967 borders are the solution but Israel 's continuous expansion and settlements have impeded this . Seizing your neighbor 's land is not a very good example to show if you want to live side by side . Injustice feeds resentment and a vicious cycle of conflict . <p> You attack Israel and lose now you want everything back you lost ? Poor widdle arabs . Do nt want to share the sandbox , TUFF ! ! ! <p> June 6 , 2011 at 1:02 pm <p> Infidel <p> Funny how the wealthy oil producing nations have the military backing of the US , whereas the non oil producing nations do not .

Through-out their history since independence from the Turks , the British , French , Italians , the Arab countries have never been able to agree on anything amongst each other .

Reasonable people will be able to thrive when they can collectively govern themselves . While tyrants or propped up dictators are still in charge the region will remain chaotic . Fareed I hope your prediction is a correct one . <p> I do n't see how anyone can write a piece about the conflict in the Middle East and not mention Israel . The only reason for the bond between many Middle Eastern countries is their common hatred of Israel . As long as Muslims do not believe that Israel has a right to exist , there will be continued conflict . Only when Muslims learn to accept and tolerate the existence of non-Muslims will there be peace in the Middle East . <p> Pardon me , I did n't realize Europeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth ( sarcasm ) . <p> April 22 , 2011 at 4:47 pm <p> elob <p> It is also ok to speak of Muslims without mentioning peace , intelligence , compassion . <p> April 22 , 2011 at 5:31 pm <p> mah <p> anon , not only non muslims , they even treat muslims from different sect , brutally , genocide in bahrain , here is an example , saudi arabia and other .. too bad israel and the arab world do nt make peace , , that would be a miracle , , and the end of all this turmoil <p> why do you folks mix papers ? ? ? or is this intentional . Egypt and the arab world is not oonly moslem . It is moslem and christian and secular . why do you spread Islamophobia ? Islam is full of compassion and great values with millions and millions of followers all over the world . show some respect to the minds and souls of the millions who follow Islam . They probably have a reason for being so passionate about their religion . after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with you Ihab Ell Attar . It may surprise some readers to know that there was a time where the Arabs ruled Spain and throughout their 800 year rule Muslims , Christians and Jews lived in relative peace . In this period of time culture , education and the art of medicine made massive gains . Further to that it was only a couple of hundred years before this that Islam was even founded . It was under Islamic rule in Morocco when the first degree granting university was founded and this , by a woman . In looking toward cultural enlightenment and understanding I think we should all look toward our own backyards first . I do not know if this is true for you in your country , however it strikes me as odd that in the school and indeed also the university system where I am from Arabic is not a part of the education system . We can learn Spanish , German , French , Chinese , Japanese and Portuguese . We need to start introducing Arabic to the curriculum of western countries in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading this articlehttp : **28;6618;TOOLONG ... become more educated on the subject and less tunnel visioned , help the world to become more accepting by educating yourself in other cultures . <p> April 22 , 2011 at 7:06 pm <p> Get Real <p> I I remember while I was traveling in Egypt my tour guide threatening to have my head cut off because my other half innocently mentioned that I do n't believe in god . A few months after we left Egypt 60 Germans were killed off in Egypt . You fools are crazy , when it comes to Islam as a whole , they are really nice people right up until you do n't agree with them . Then you have to make sure you got duct table so your head can be taped back together . <p> April 28 , 2011 at 11:50 pm <p> Woody <p> The middle east can be dangerous .

Anyone who hase never been there will never know the kindness of strangers that I experienced as an American . There is good and bad in all groups of people . All I can say is I am glad for the experience . The kind people that I met there . If I ever go back , I am sure it will have lost some of its charm in many of its old ways . For better or worse ! Its a place where in many ways , time has stood still ! <p> at least someone who appreciate the people of the middle east . well spoken woody , I am lebanese american born , What is happening is crazy in the arab world , , it meant to be anyway , it was all repressed , I hope y get to go back end enjoy the hospitality and the splendor of some areas in the middle east . ( excluding saudi arabia of course and some other arab states , where democracy does n't exist . and they hate foreigners or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing goes will with these countrier . They all have one common problem " Population &; Poverty " If any country has this , then Islamic extremism and Jehadi 's will rise . Lets hope and payer for better living condition in those region . <p> It is strange silence from 99% of the media including you , that this " Mid-East Spring " , bears no relationship to the US fight for democracy in Iraq , on behalf of the Iraq people . Yes there is some turmoil , as is expected in a fledging free society ; however , is it not the wellspring of this initial transformation that planted the seed for democracy and people power the " mustard seed " that George W Bush said could happen if people see and witness this recent history ? <p> Yes , ten years is a long time but given the horizon of history , especially in the Mid-East , we may well be on the road to a better way of life for this area of the world . <p> I agree . Despite the media 's focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars , the positive results have tremendous effects , even ten years later . But of course , bad news sells better so you would rarely hear the good stuff ... <p> What if alternative energy ( Bio fuel- Super efficiency and powerful batteries etc etc ) become viable for mass production/consumption in next 5 yrs and thus minimizing dependence on Saudi exports . Will SA or OPEC still be in position to bribe its citizenry into submission ? <p> Not to sound like a conspiracy theorists , but there are a lot of influential companies that profit off of these oil rich countries . They would at the very least slow down the path to super efficiency to more than five years , let alone introducing that technology into the midde east . <p> In ten years the faces will be very different , I however am not so sure about their ideology . Same with the issues here in America ; Still very much a plutocracy , always has been always will be . Power corrupts , absolute power corrupts absolutely ... <p> Zakaria , you nearly totally ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation of Mosque and State and they are all tyrannies to one degree or another . You may laud Indonesia , Zakaria , but consider the fact that not terribly long ago a simple , gentle Indonesian man was sentenced to DEATH by the Courts of Indonesia . His Crime ? ? He had converted to Christianity . Likewise , just this past year , an Egyptian man and his entire family were condemned to death by the Courts of Egypt . His crime ? Again , he had converted to Christianity ( the courts had forbidden him to convert ) . This is n't " religion " -- it is outright fascism . So where are the tens of thousands of the citizens of these countries who supposedly want " democracy " according to your narrative ? I did n't about any of them ranting in the streets to fight for the Freedom of Conscience of these individuals . And you wo n't . You know why ? Because these societies are overwhelmingly Islamic and intolerant of other religions and Sharia Law is embedded to one degree or another in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( an oxymoron if EVER there was one ) , clerics can call for the execution of ANYONE who converts to another religion . Even LEAVING Islam of your own FREE WILL can get you executed as you are then branded " an apostate . " YOU may see a rosy picture ahead , but I SEE even greater tyranny as Islamists consolidate more and more of their control over the central government of these regimes . Egypt showed every sign of moving in this direction IMMEDIATELY after Mubarak stepped down . They invited Iran to sail through the Suez with their warships and Egyptian politicians still in power kept up the spouting of how the former treaty with Israel might be rescinded . These are the people who are going to have " democracy ? ? " You Westerners make the assumption that the Islamic world is just like us , that they actually WANT to be Free . I do n't believe that at all . None of them have the infrastructure in place for any true democracy and in the end , the REAL TYRANT in their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than 80% of Egyptians , Zakaria , in a poll this past year expressed their support of the Execution of Homosexuals , Adulterers and ANYONE who leaves Islam . Good luck with your dreaming , Zakaria . Only a total revolution against the repressive force of Islam could change these societies . Ai n't gon na happen ....... <p> In my humble opinion you are absolutely right . I have traveled through out the Middle East and have lived in Egypt for many years and I think your thoughts about the subject correspond much closer to reality than Zakaria 's which are influenced by western culture . Your comment was very interesting and I also think that as long as this pseudo religion exists in the Middle East change will be extremely slowly and painful . But time is running out and very dark days are coming faster than we think . <p> really ! ! You lived in Egypt ? folks on internet : be aware of people who spread islamophobia and speak in a demeaning manner of the arab and moslem world . They misrepresent facts . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world will learn from other sources other than fox news and " Holloywood " dominated media . The clock is ticking <p> April 22 , 2011 at 5:20 pm <p> marat <p> How much insanity that emanates from the Islamic world has to exist before people wake up and understand that Islam has far , far more in common with other totalitarian ideologies than any actual " religion ? " It is OBSESSED by both the control of the individual as well as attempting to fulfill its Koranic mandate to spread Islam , through violence if necessary , in order to ultimately subjugate the rest of the world under its ideology . I am the last in the world to be a conspiracy theorist . But read the Koran -- it is one of the most despicably violently inciting documents which is overwhelming in its hatred of the Jews as well as any other group ( a.k.a. " infidels " or " non-believers " ) who refuse to accept Islamic dogma . The WORLDWIDE epidemic today of Muslim terror ( extant in some 20 nations around the globe ) could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the U.S. Constitution and our Bill of Rights . Islam SANCTIONS its so-called " clerics " to order the execution of ANYONE who is deemed to be " A Threat To Islam , " often with huge sums of money offered . World famous ( and Muslim by birth ) writer Salman Rushdie and the gentle , elderly Danish cartoonist ( Westergaard ) who drew the brilliant cartoon of an Eastern looking individual with a bomb and lit fuse in his turban , both lived in a state of terror for years as Muslim would-be assassins hunted for them . Five years later , just this past year , Westergaard 's home was broken into by a Muslim with an axe who was attempting to kill him . He just received a long sentence . To put Islam in perspective , imagine this in the U.S. or EU : that all Rabbis , Priests and Ministers would be SANCTIONED by the state to call for the death of anyone who they claim to be " a threat " to their respective faiths . Insanity . The Bottom Line : Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is , in essence , a Supremacist ideology , a theo-political ideology that has little reverence for life . Perhaps Bin Laden stated it best in one of his tapes that was forward to the press years ago : " YOU Love Life , While We Love Death . " To date since 9/11 , some 17,095 people have been slaughtered by MUSLIM terrorists , the vast majority being Muslims themselves . My claim is simple : Israel is not the problem for Muslim ; nor America or the EU or Asian democracies . The MAIN tyrant that haunts Muslims is none of these , it is ISLAM itself , which is repressive , opposed to democracy ( Islam is theocratic ) and which has little respect for Human Conscience or Freedom of Will . I also predict that the uprisings in today 's Muslim nations/regimes will bring even greater tyranny to these lands within a relatively short while . There will be huge civil strife between the totalitarian Islamist populations of these socieities and those who wish to have reform . But NO True " REFORM " will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that about would be the very revision of Islami Ideology -- and I doubt that Muslims will permit the Koran to be re-written today . Read it . It should be essential reading for Westerners , as it is the only true way of understanding this barbaric and intolerant ideology that has replaced Communism as the main Totalitarian force in our world today . In fact , it makes Communism look like a philanthropic organization by comparison .... <p> I do respect your predictions , but you are wrong my friend , the 800-pound gorilla will fall and soon , and when it falls it will be very hard to get up ( falling and can not get up , lol ) . I do not know how much you know about Saudi culture and their repressive ruling system ! , if you really do a detailed research you will changed your prediction , this country has nothing but A CRUEL CULTURE AND CONTEMPRARY FORMS OF SALAVERY , hope they go to hell . <p> What I know of Saudi society is that is was absolutely sickening to watch Obama bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a vile , vile regime , with a never ending string of newborn royalty being born over time . Here is a snapshot for the unitiated : Saudi Arabia -- No Jews allowed ; Bo Bibles allowed ; No other Churches allowed ; No other religion other than Strict Islam allowed ; no women permitted to work in close proximity with males ; no women permitted to hold high office or to vote ; homosexuals periodically executed , morals " police " constantly patrolling to judge the suitablilty of womens ' clothing ; and for an extra joy of Islamic life , there are even " Muslim ONLY " roads . The Islamic world is fond of calling Israel an " Apartheid " State . Ridiculous . It is a thriving and vibrant democracy , a small economic powerhouse of a society ( it led all G8 nations in growth this past year ) , with world class research universities partnered with the best universities in the world . Tiny Israel has produced MORE Nobel winners within 63 years , than the ENTIRE Islamic world since 1911 . Perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you count Arafat , who invented airplane hijacking . Jews : a mere 0.02% of the world population , with over 174 Nobel Winners , some 27% of all prizes , with higher percentages in particular categories ( physic , economics , physiology , medicine ) . Keep heading the Jews , I say to the Muslim states -- you owe your very life to their contributions to humanity in virtually every field . <p> How can some steal and claim to be a vibrant democracy ... read Mohammad Asad 's Road to Mecca . It may broaden your perspective . <p> April 23 , 2011 at 2:05 am <p> Paul <p> Looking forward to the demise of the house of Saud -- agreed one of the most vile regimes in the world ! <p> April 23 , 2011 at 2:40 am <p> Sockness Monster <p> President Bush kissed them all on the cheek and held hands , but thats ok huh ? When visiting another nation its diplomatic protocal to follow the customs of that nation . Nobody complained when our leaders bow to the Japanese But everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Ameriaca visiting dignitaries shake hands ( Protocal ) Refusing to do so would be an insult . <p> You should spend more time learning how the world works and less time babbling garbage . <p> June 6 , 2011 at 1:15 pm <p> Amit-Atlanta-USA <p> I do n't know what you mean with your reference to Israel . But , it 's foolhardy to believe that Israel will go away UNLESS the Iranians , Pakistanis use their ISLAMIC BOMBS to wipe Israel off the map ! <p> I stand to agree and disagree with your views . Yes , I can see Saudi Arabia ( SA ) becoming a Constantinople of today . The US is not enforcing any form of democratic manner , but opening the eyes of the civilians of the essence of freedom from tyranny . Democracy as a whole is a working cycle that continues to evolve . The possibilities are endless for SA . I do disagree in the retorts in this article . Other countries can only offer support in a resolution for other countries . Not one country can be the " defining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves but they are doing so by asserting different avenues to allow themselves to be a functioning society . SA is the center of the Islam world , that much is true . A lot of very educated individuals live there and , quite frankly , a lot of well-educated terrorist organizations as well . We are all dual-sided ... no doubt . As for Egypt , I love the country even with its rich history of tyranny and slave labor . Egypt has the opportunity to do what the Bohemian Revolution did for France . Freedom and democracy start with ideas and then flourish , correct ? Then I say we take a step back , help if it is needed and see a country grow into the country that it is destined to be . The more we bicker and argue over what other countries are taking steps towards acheiving , we are becoming more and more like Rome . Everyone needs a dream or an idea of freedom and I believe that the Arab world should have the same opportunity . <p> I agree with Zakaria here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves out a few problems . For instance , in 10 years , Yemen will have no oil left . Yemen is already in trouble , and without oil it will become a serious problem . Really , 10 years is not much time at all for a nation . I wish the Egyptian people the best . <p> But what passes for moderation in the middle east would be considered fascism and get a person sent to prison here . I am not very hopeful about that part of the world . Some wonderful , smart , great people are there , but the region is ruled by ideologies that are nasty . <p> I hope it is fundamentally different in that it is Christian , not Islam . Best day of my life was when I converted away from that false religion of hate and inequality . My fellow women , reach out to Jesus even if you must only do so in your mind because of the fear you live in from the men around you . ( True ) Peace be upon you . <p> Marat makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law is a foundation for the unethical persecution of minorities by clerics and governements when they see fit . Liberty and Freedom requires separation of state and religion . I do not percive the rights of individuals as a priotiy at this time in the middle east . I pray as a Christian individual rights evolve over time as a path to peace and prosperity in the middle east . <p> It 's interesting , but a lot of politicians and pundits have said for decades that the center of the Middle East is the Israeli-Palestinian dispute . Nothing will happen until it is resolved . Well , it seems that the revolutions going on are independent of the dispute and I do n't see you , Mr. Zakaria , even mentioning it in your prediction of the future . Sounds like all of the politicians and pundits were wrong after all . But I do hope for a peaceful and fair solution for both sides . <p> I think the three main countries to focus on are Saudi Arabia , Israel , and Iran . Iran has a large opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is aware that whatever change happens in Egypt will affect Israel . I think Israel will start the peace process all over again only out of concern for their own security . Saudi Arabia I think will remain the same as it was for a long time unless a reform minded monarch comes to the throne like what happened when King Hamid of Bahrain succeeded his father , King Isa . I doubt that will happen since the Saudi royal family is very conservative . <p> I think you have overlooked the most critical country in the Middle East : Israel . The Middle East in ten years can not be evaluated without considering Israel 's situation in ten years and the reaction of the Moslem nations to it . If nothing revolutionary occurs with the Arab-Israeli dispute , the mid-East will become even more unstable . <p> Israel , to me , seems stuck in its history . Because of the threats against it , Israel has become a warrior state , always on alert . All its actions are taken in consideration of , and constrained by , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . In addition , its internal policies of providing a homeland for the Jews , are driving a massive contradiction : protection of and freedom for the Jews , many Israelis seem to believe , can not be achieved while providing equality and freedom to the Palestinians , living within Israel . Demography has also become a threat : the growing population of Palestinians will eventually make Jews a minority in their own homeland . <p> Revolution will come to Israel , though not as an Islamic Intifadah aimed at destroying the Jews . Instead , unarmed protests will develop during which the Palestinians demand better political and economic rights . They will demand , in particular , guaranteed property rights against settler appropriation , the right of free movement throughout the country , the destruction of the walls that slice up Israel into pieces . They will also seek a non-sectarian state . Bombings , rocket attacks , and screams of " Death to the Jews " will not attract the sympathy or support of the world . A truly non-violent struggle for civil rights equality will . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a movement . But in less than ten years time , they will have figured it out . <p> Israel will have no peace until it changes its negotiating position with the Arabs . Now , Israel will not negotiate unless the Arabs first recognize Israel 's right to exist . The Arabs know that once they make that concession , Israel will have no need to negotiate further , because achieving Arab recognition of its right to exist is Israel 's ultimate and only important goal . But Israel is not willing to give up anything to reach this goal . It is not willing to negotiate on anything to reach this goal . <p> Comparing the relative military strengths of Israel and its enemies , Palestinians and their friends have nothing to negotiate with , other than recognition . Recognition is the only bargaining chip they have . If Israel is not willing to negotiate all other issues , before-and conditioned on-recognition , there will be no negotiations . The stalemate is actually fairly advantageous for Israel . It knows its enemies can not drive it into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any concessions to the Palestinians . So , Israel now has the next best thing to recognition of its right to exist : the power to maintain its existence regardless of what the Arabs think . Ultimately , the issue in ten years will be the nature of the relationship between Israel and the United States . If the US is unable or unwilling to move Israel to a less rigid negotiating position , there really will be a major , violent explosion in the Middle East that will bring unanticipated and unwelcome change . <p> rblackbird- the palestenien nationle dream is the right of return of all 1948 refugees in to israel proper , and as a result-to destroy israel as the nationle state of the jewish people . most of israelis and all of israeli leadership are in favor of establishing a palestenien state . ( including " hardliner " liberman ) <p> all israeli arabs have equel rights ( not obligations , as for most iaraeli arabs do nt serve in the army , and refuse also non military nationle service ) . descremination exist as with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less discriminated then europien muslims . ( for example- the head judge of israeli ex presidnt 's rape triele , gorge kara- is arab ) <p> and last- all truly funnctioninig democracies in the world are based on the existence of a strong nationle glu. the only way there will be peace in israel is if there will be two homogenus ( as possible ) states for two nations- the jewish nation , and for the first arab nation- the palesteniens <p> Persiangirl also makes a point that is the 800 pound gorrilla for Islam . Womens equality is mandatory for a society to prosper . My old fiends have told me of womens freedoms in the beautiful Pakistan of decades past . There is no honor in oppression of female equality or " Honor Killings " of those females seeking freedom . <p> The Middle East is a powder keg waiting to explode . Repression of 50% of the population for 100 's of years is bound to produce hatred . I do not understand why the women in the Middle East do not SLIT the THROATS of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of women to chattel . The select few who are allowed to be educated are the wealthy who grow up to be the Opressors . There has been so little political discourse that now when everything is blowing up in the faces of these totalitarian regimes , there is no grey area . It is a good vs evil conflict , with those in power being the evil ones who have kept prosperity from the people to further their own greedy lifestyles . But now that the world has the internet and all forms of international communication , it is possible for anyone anywhere who has an internet connection to see what real freedom and real democracy looks like and they want it . They have no way to fit the square peg of Democracy into the round hole of their Religious belief systems . It will be a very long struggle for these countries both oil rich and resource poor to make these changes evolutionary . It is myopic to believe that the Repressors will continue to redirect the hatred and anger of the masses toward Isreal and America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their crucifying ( beheading ) of believers in the Christ just as they and every Moozhaheed that puts partners with what THE GOD told them to say ( Mooslem ) , not SunniMooslem , ShiaMooslem ! These adjectives have put a hex/curse on them till they learn to read ! Peace be with the Soldiers , Christians , Jews , Moosems , Converts , Hindus , .. Mayans .. many paths with a reverency to avoid true Hell &; true Severe Punishment ( Ch. 73 of the Quraan. *May Peace be with you* <p> I find this drive in the Middle East towards greater individual self-determination with great hope , but I also understand that this process is fraught with danger for all of us . It is my sincerest belief that we must refrain from interfering in this process . The people of the Middle East MUST choose their own path with as little interference as possible from the western nations . Why ? Because at the end of this , when the citizens of Syria , Egypt and every other country experiencing turmoil look back at the road of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that they paved that road themselves ... instead of feeling like the path was laid out for them . If we interfere , go in guns blazing for " freedom " , then this whole process would just be seen as a continuation of western imperialism . We must not dictate the terms or outcome , must not force our idea of democracy upon them . They must choose a freedom that suits them for the time and place they are in , taking into account the vast differences in culture between the west and the middle eastern nations and with the understanding that our kind of democratic , secular government would be anathema to many who seek change and freedom . The change that comes , that sense of freedom they will feel , must be genuine for it to be lasting ... <p> I do not agree with your pridection for Saudi Arabia . I think the people there respect king Abdullah as a face of reason &; moderation in the Saudi massive royal family but they certainly loath all the princes from the next generation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king Abdullah dies which could be soon ( he is a sick 86 years old man ) the people will look around them &; see freedom in Egypt , Tunsia , Lybia , Yemen &; Syria they will not accept the 3rd generation of Adbel Aziz Ben Saud to continue ruling their land &; embezzle their Oil revenues . I can not see any future for this family after the current generation . <p> Which part is false ? Perhaps Saudi Arabia has more money but most of that is controlled by the royal family . The average standard of living is higher in Israel . Of course if you hate Jews ..... <p> April 22 , 2011 at 5:56 pm <p> Huh ? <p> He ( or She ) is correct however much you disagree . <p> Look what Israel has done with a basically unwanted plot of desert in 63 years . <p> I saw no Palestinians fighting for it back in 1947 . It was not until it started becoming successful , the Mullahs got nervous about losing control of their own " flock " to the wonderment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe . <p> Before then Arab and Jew alike lived in relative peace for thousands of years in the region . <p> All you have to do is go back and read George W Bush on the 10 year prodiction for the Middle East . He prediticted that Democracy would be sweeping the Middle East within 10 years . I do n't hear a lot credit given to blood , sweat , tears and treasury we gave in Iraq to stimulate the sweeping change in the Middle East that has the potential to bring peace and stability to such a unpredictable part of the world . <p> Good summary - you 're more often right than wrong , so this is heartening to read . Could you do a follow up column on what this might mean for Israel ? I am concerned that Netanyahu &; co are stuck in hardliner mode , Hamas is stuck in hardliner mode , and both seem defiant/dismissive toward the need to negotiate ( and make REAL concessions ) toward a two-state solution . <p> ... would be true except for the fact that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , rather , they are looking at creating this bogus nightmare apocalyptic reality because Muhammad said so . Nice God-work , Mo . <p> I am from Lebanon . Born Christian but I am currently atheist . The problem comes down to educating people . People will become less religious , less scared from the unknown . Then the change will come from within . The biggest problem with the US policy is forcing democracy on uneducated religious people instead of spending this money on promoting education . The problem in our country is education as well . Education will make people conscious and evolution will follow naturally . <p> Nailed it ! The reason why there are all these extremists running around the Middle East is because of the low quality of education there . It really does n't matter what religious background you are , if you are uneducated , the only way you know of solving your problems is violence . <p> State sponsored education has a problem . For example , in Germany , a law was established that made it a criminal offense to homeschool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper indoctrination of the youth . It sounds like a pretty good idea until you realize who enacted the law . It was established in 1938 by Audolph Hitler . It was very effective . Many organization sprang from it like the Hitler youth , etc . Germany still enforces this same law today . <p> Zakaria has not mentioned the obvious conclusion about mid-east Democracy . The model the region will follow will be the same as that for Iran after the Shah was gone . Once the mid-east dictators are thrown out of power , and Democracy is established , it will be short lived . It all comes to an abrupt hault after the first vote when the islamic parties win solid victories , and the mullahs take power . Then it will be dictatorship again , but from a far more repressive direction . There can be no good end to this . <p> Zakaria , I agree with most of the comments but still i want to shed light on another issue . You did not mention about the possibility of emerging a new independent state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Kurds in Iraq will be independent within the next ten years ? <p> Who would recognize Kudistan ? It should be an independent country , but does Turkey want that ? Do the other mid-east states want that ? Would America want that ? ( Americans would welcome it , but not our leaders , to much oil at stake ) <p> I do n't know where Mr. Zakaria gets his news from but apparently he is not really in touch with the Islamic extremism movement ( funded by Saudi Arabia ) that will turn Egypt and a few other countries into other Afghanistans ! <p> I 'm thinking one could have change in the oil countries as well . After all , look at Libya ! they produce a ton of oil for Europe , and Gadaffi 's regime , though not gone , certainly will never recover . I think it depends on the people , not the wealth of the dictator . As far as those who think the middle east " ca n't handle democracy " , I say that this is the same paternalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle East are humans the same as us , and can have the same cognitive abilities . They can look to the example Iran has set , and avoid that future , knowing that it will lead to the same oppression . They can look at Afghanistan and Pakistan , and see the folly of an overtly fundamentalist government . If Islamic parties are voted in , they will likely be on the level of the Muslim Brotherhood , which no more desires a Jihad than European Catholic parties desire an Inquisition . <p> to Richie , let me give you some updates on what 's happening in Egypt for Example : <p> Christians are being attacked in their homes in different areas by Muslims ( not by Extremists ) , by regular Muslims . They have burned their homes , stole their properties , ruined their businesses . All that , in the name of Islam . Again I am talking about people like me and you , not by organized groups . And to add to that , it 's all happening front of the military and Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypocritical media will not allow for such news to be exposed ! <p> And I 'm telling you all that this is a tragedy . These countries will fall to extremiest and muslim fanatics and the west will suffer greatly in the next ten years . <p> Ask america , why did you favor the ousting of mr mubarak or why do you support the rebels in libiya , do n't you see that coming back and bite you in the rear end ? Why do we make that mistake time after time . <p> These people have one solution to them and that is mubarak , gadahffi , sadam hussein , etc <p> Israel will not have any problems in the future , nothing will change the status quo . <p> As for Egypt , I beg to differ . As an Egyptian , I am telling you , removing Mubarak was a HUGE mistake . Country will slowly move into an Islamic rule , the economic problems ca n't and will not be resolved , simply because Mubarak was not fully responsible for them . Do n't forget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinets were changing every six months . <p> Through out its history , Egypt was a success story during the reign on dictators . Ramsis during ancient times , Mohamed Ali Pasha and Anwar Sadat , democracy will not work in Egypt , it has n't in the past &; will not work in the future . Egypt is going to be the new Iraq . On the other hand , watch the Cuban transformation , this is going to be a huge success story in the near future , just like China is in the present . <p> I recently visited China . In two weeks I travelled to many cities of various sizes . I was amazed at the pace they are developing . You 're right . The government will have to manage itself very carefully and change in a way to allow people more freedoms and movement . Shenzen ( near HK ) is amazing . <p> April 22 , 2011 at 6:44 pm <p> 10 years ? ? <p> We will all be fortunate AS HUMANS if we are all still here in 10 months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom to REALLY talk and halk can not do anything but call people silly childish names and point at the " other side " to assess blame . <p> Bring it on as I am sick of the current state of anger -- all over the planet . <p> Until we ALL learn to work together , what are we really working towards for future generations . <p> LOOK INWARD . We all have common desires -- do not let extremists of ANY religion dictate your hearts . <p> Our differences are so tiny compared to our similarities as HUMAN BEINGS . <p> Zakaria is no journalist . He never says anything that is n't already obvious to everyone else . His so-called " predictions " are worthless . I 'm a retired journalist and I have seen people taken in by this fake spiel before . <p> ok , great article , very diplomatically correct as in W ARE not going to offend anyone here etc hakuna matata. and in the end it is hakuna matata thing . i think primaly it is a concern of people 's lives not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ups and downs slowly poisoning everyone 's lives . pretty spooky . <p> noone can and should predict the future especially when it comes to orient and particularly to middle east . i say there be lots of surprises coming up and may god forbid there be innocent souls lose . things ll settle down and inchallah everyone will have basic grounds of humane existence . <p> as for israel , whether some hope it vanishes from earth 's face , it is still there and will be . maybe in different way as in giudea and israel yet it will be . people are facing far more serious troubles there . constant fright from both unknowning whats going to happen and whether government is playing the right card . corruption is no longer a novice nor a danger . one cant fight it , especially whereas a lots of money . it is unfair to judge a nation on their government 's propaganda . most of the people are sick and tired of brainwash , read Gideon Levy and you will see . btw the israeli singer Rita is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Yemen , Ishtar from Morocco and Egypt and etc. the known art figures are from arab origin , so what ? is this a secret campaign ? no , it s life . hug to all , inchallah all ur dreams come true and happiness will reign over the world and middle east . LOVE REIGNS OVER THE WORLD- MONEY OVER WEAK PEOPLE <p> Please refresh my memory .. I believe these are the bas ( * &ds; that want to wipe the USA of the face of this earth . They want kill all Christians simply because they are Christians ut they have no difficulty worshipping a recorded child molester . The quicker they are eliminated the better ..... <p> i really would n't look to indonesia for any sort of model . it has become far more extreme -- in terms of both its population , its government , and its various terrorist groups -- in recent years than it was even ten years ago . it is very difficult to do business in the country , it was hit hard by the recession , and literacy rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aceh , recently implemented shariah law with predictably disastrous results . if egypt is looking for a " muslim role model " , it should look to turkey instead . turkey has huge problems as well , but it 's vastly more stable than indonesia . <p> unfortunately , i doubt that will happen . egypt is a poor , fundamental-islam-driven society with an illiteracy rate hovering around 33%. i can easily see it ( but not tunisia ) going the way of iran , with strict religious law ruling the country . but i hope it does n't , for everyone 's sake . <p> i do n't always agree with Fareed Zakaria , but i always found his comments interesting , until now . this little piece is n't worthy of his bi-line. he must be on vacation , because he obviously phoned this one in. the future of the middle east can not be discussed without discussing the half of the population that lives in near slavery- the women . show me a country that values the contributions of all of it 's members and i 'll show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing the middle east without discussing what happens in iran ( an outside player -- yes i know ) is also useless . syria ... hmmm ... yeah , kind of important in the discussion too . how about jordan ? if the king is assassinated the size of palestine just quadruples overnight . how many days/weeks/years before that happens ? how does that play out ? come on man , give us a real thoughtful discussion . you can do better than this ! <p> okay ........ it is seemed that u do n't knw any thing about islam or muslems , , , , i wan na 2 tell u small something there is 5 million christians n egypt .... we save them like our brothers and that was clear n days of revolution " if u knw any thing abt it " soo be far abt them .. and if u really wan na 2 help boor christians , , , , blame isreal about her mistakes agianst them in palastine <p> It 's nice to have dreams . The only democracy in the middle east is israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another corrupt idiot comes to power . Granted Egypt has the best chance of breaking this trend , but I 'll believe it when I see it . My prediction , hello Muslim brotherhood aka religious fanatic terrorists . <p> You forgot about the man , Biatch . The big nuke , the asteroid that popped the dinosaurs into extinction . The middle east will be what America wants it to be . If we want free nations with free trade so we can feed our consumerism population of sheep then we will have just that in the middle east . The man controls all of you little lambs . <p> Peace in the middle east ? I do n't think so . Not 1,000 years ago , not 10 years from now , accept never . I am a christian but I do n't let those in prominent positions tell me what to think or how to act . I take the good and I toss out the bad . I treat people as I want to be treated . You ca n't teach hate or intolerance and expect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve . Are there muslims who do the same as I do with my religion ? I 'm sure there are those that reject the extreme and abide by the good . As for the US and it 's position in world politics , we are n't perfect and our leaders sometimes make bad decisions but I think over the 200+ years of it 's existence the US has done more to promote peace , prosperity , freedom , and human rights than any other country in the world . We 're in debt up to our eyeballs but we 're still the most generous people on earth when others are in need . Enough said , there are good people everywhere but good will never overcome evil in the middle east . It just ai n't gon na happen . <p> Of course the U.S. promotes peace , which leads to prosperity . Peace is an essential aspect of capitalism . Peace is only promoted because it serves American interests . The native American people were wiped out in the name of peace . There was too much conflict over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men were dragged from their home and enslaved by the government to promote prosperity . Indeed the government does promote prosperity ... its own prosperity . America was founded upon bloodshed , slavery and bigotry , among other cruel aspects of humanism . The world wars were the only righteous aspects of this empires ' existence . Soon after , the government would remove helpless indigenous people from their island to test powerful tools of destruction ... castle bravo . The government also conducted human experimentation on minority people.The people they used were weak and defenceless ... just like our enemy today . You are a lamb . You probably believe that you live in a Democracy with elected officials . y You live in an oligarchy where the rich use their power to put " politicians " or puppets in office . You should study our political and economic systems . <p> Do n't misinterpret my statements ... I ca n't stand Muslims and their revolution wo n't change the fact that they are barbarians . Even god said to his sons of Israel not to mate with the neighbouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years ago . Muhammad is a false prophet who bangs other men . He is a symbol of barbarism . <p> April 23 , 2011 at 11:06 am <p> Romia <p> Sad , but true . There 's too much apathy in America and that 's the way the government likes it . The dumber the citizens , the better for the government and those who pay the politicians . WAKE UP people and smell the coffee . Stop being taken by liars and thieves ; for the people , by the people is what it 's SUPPOSED to be , but it 's not . It 's the politicians that are not following the Constitution . Citizens worldwide demonstrate for what they believe while we sit back and get knocked out in the ring . <p> April 24 , 2011 at 3:34 am <p> AmericanModerator <p> This is a very good and reasonable prediction from someone who 's taken time to listen and learn about what 's happening in this region . Once again FZ shows much more depth and piecing together relevant facts and predictions than most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whichever way the stronger winds are blowing today . <p> " Kinder , gentler monarchies " what BS . They are only " kinder and gentler " if you do n't question the " rights " of the " royal " families to all the oil wealth . If you do question too loudly you disappear . What 's " gentle or kind " about that ? These so called royal families hold billions of dollars in personal wealth and it 's still not enough . The families still vie for even more money an power while significant proportions of the population just get by . The time of " kings " and royalty is long past . The people are waking up . If these monarchs are really enlightened they must lead the way toward democracy and give the money they have stolen back to the people . Do you see that happening in Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , Qatar , Oman or Libya ? <p> I think that u mighg be right in your predictions but we also have to take in consideration the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world where the development of system of mass comunication and the way that ideas are spread and how the evolution of those ideas impact mainly in the youth of each and every country is allowing the emergence of new waves of change . The social relatoon between people is changing and is going to keep changing . We , from my humble point of view , can not always refer to the past to evaluate how changes are going to take place . We are witnessing an evolutionary process that had never happened before intense wise . I think that the world as a whole is tending to be more even with certain pockets of radicalism but I think that the countries that are not oil rich.and those who are , eventualy are going to converge in a more equal system for its people . Common sense at the end of the day will prevail and open political systems are going to be much more open and offer more equal possibilities to their people . Thank you for your analysis . Always very thoughtful . <p> Funny , I fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its effect . In 30 years I have no doubt that at least 40-50 percent of the worlds oil use will be transitioned into alternatives . Now , the world will still depend on oil but the price will be very high by then due to high demand and lower output with multiple super economies jockeying for position . Assuming the conditions are similar to what they are today and growths pan out to current predictions . I also feel by then that countries holding out on their own natural supplies ( the US ) will have already started setting up their own **28;6648;TOOLONG facilities leading to less and less profits for the middle east . What will be the economic stabilizer in the region ? Thirty years is really reaching nowadays . 1981 was 30 years ago from this year . Could you imagine someone then predicting what kind of life they would live in 30 years ? Or what the geopolitical situation would be like for that matter . <p> Fareed Zakaria is one of the most astute observers of mid east politics , but I think he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive repression not just bribery as he notes to control its population . I agree that this country will in the final analysis go through an evolutionary process of change , if only because of the country 's ability to share more of its wealth with ordinary citizens . However , when it comes to Egypt the challenges and risks are huge . It is very difficult to see any structural change occuring in that country depite what appears to be huge changes in leadership taking place . This is because of uncertainties over the army 's role , and that of the Muslim Brotherhood . There is potential for more violence as many of the rights essential to build a civil society have not been granted . Take women for example . Their role and rights seem to have actually diminished over time . Furthermore , political prisoners are still held by the Army and a bizarre alliance seems to have come to life between the military and the Muslim brotherhood , at the expense of liberal forces in the country . Egyptians may yet find themselves trading one form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here typify the problem in the Muslim world , always blaming others for their wrong and corrupt societies . Israel is one of the smallest countries in the world in terms of population and geography with no diplomatic ties to 55 of the Islamic countries . Hence Israel has nothing to do with what is going on in the Muslim countries . This is simply as a result of the greater knowledge of the world that is now available through the internet and easily accessible to all . People can see how others are treated and live relative to their state . They realize that they have been feed lies and the extent of the corruption . However , even if the Governments change until the culture transforms little progress will occur . In Islamic countries 90% of all minorities have evaporated over the past 100 years . Simply Islamic countries are the least tolerant . This intolerance creates little acceptance of free thinking and many who disagree are treated harshly . This culture of intolerance that has made minorities not able to coexist in Islamic countries will not allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the middle east , I see two extremely opposite cultures . A lot of the kids are westernized , wearing jnco jeans and have ipods . This really really really is the opposite of the other population . Up untill about 30 years ago , there were one of the more homogonous populations in the world . When we think about the cultural changes that have taken place in our country over TWO HUNDRED years , coming from a less homogenized culture , and try to compress that into 30 years , this can give you insight into what is going on over there . Our culture today has many , many different facets . Again , there 's has two , and they are polar opposites . WHAT is going to happen when they run out of oil ? They are not making it right now , they should be rich . <p> We are almost bankrupt and should act like a bankrupt nation instead of acting like a meddling power of the world . Get our own house in order first and put the fires out at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires and starting new fires overseas throughout the world . We should get out of the middle east and let them settle their own problems . Middle east is a hell hole and will keep burning in fire for another 100 years . We should get self sufficient in energy by producing at home . <p> The author hit the nail on the head.Oil rich countries countries do bribe their citizens.In Kuwait for example , the citizens receive food allowances , jobs &; houses etc. every month.There will never be an uprising until the day their oil runs out and the government is not able to provide the people with all the benefits they have been accustomed to for so many years . <p> that 's what happens in any nation that has given to its citizens , and then taken away ... example the social perks given to Greek citizens and now cut back one by one ; same will happen here if **25;6678;TOOLONG is cut back after enjoying it . Solution should be to be more selective to new people getting the benefits so they do n't get used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far too superficial to view oil riches as the dividing line between countries of the middle east . Factors that can play into the destiny of countries in this part of the world are so many and far too diverse for anyone to really accurately project where these countries will end up in a few years time . Things like population size , country resources , level of impoverishment , neighbouring countries , historic roles for the country , number of respectable universities in the country , cultural make up , and ethnic homogeneity will all play out major and crucial roles . In particular , comparing egypt to indonesia is most disappointing . The differences are so striking between both countries . Egypt is a country about to embark upon democracy after a historic medling with democratic concepts , ideals , and autonomies from even before the date of colonizations . Egypt has institutions and laws that are well founded and could be relied upon in steering the country safely . The least testament to these is the recent investigations into mubarak and his families ' wealth and corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so recently . Factor that in with the immense potentials of an already flourishing tourism with even far greater potential , the presence of fundemantal resources spread across the country , a strategic position that could potentially render it the trade hub of this part of the world and the greatest link between Europe , Africa , and Asia . Add in the cheap labor that is the hallmark of the country at the present time , and gives it the best chances to get built so fast ..... and you have the equation for a country skyrocketing into the 21st century . Yes , I am extremely optimistic . But as an arab I tell you this ..... After the cedar revolution was quenched in my country , lebanon , I had a feeling that change in this part of the world is at once impossible and unreal . Looking now towards egypt and tunisia , I feel a shimmer of hope for a rekindled Arab pride . That is the same feeling that everyone else has in this part of the world . Be it in Syria , Libya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the arab world , that glimpse of a prosperous future can drive us towards the impossible and the unreal . Do not take that away from us . <p> Big fan of Zakaria , must say . I think dichotomizing the regional developments in term of bribery/repression is a very bright way to look at it . I wish I could say I have some insightful thoughts to add , but hopefully uprisings in the more repressed nations lead to more democratic governance . Channeling the productive capacity and energy of their people towards collectively agreed upon goals without needing to shut down large swaths of the population would definitely help any of them take strides towards some more unified picture of the future . Does that make sense ? Uhhhh .... <p> A change to democracy without secularism is not an improvement and can even be a big step backwards . Take a look at democracy in the Palestinian territories or the political system of Iran , in which the President is democratically elected . A wise , benevolent and modern Sheikh is far preferable to a backward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality a theocracy . <p> Saudi Arabia can become a strong country in the region provided , the system will be built on honest and transparent , people welfare oriented approach.Egypt with its resourses and intellectual power , can become like lebanon which did well untill some external interference.Whether oil or non oil dependent nations , each nation can progress to something of its own , provided they are focussed on the funamental principals of humanity , honest and transparent system that cares for the welfare of its people by providing good education , jobs and agriculture.Most important is non interference with other nations-good foriegn policy.Israel can become a regional Guru provided the Arab nations treat and embrace independent Israel as a friendly nation rather than an enemy , becoz of its distinct history and the intellectual power.Not least is the right spiritual guidence and secularism.For any Democratic country to prosper , people should learn to go by right or wrong and perform their duties , not only claim their rights . <p> Thank you Fareed for your assessment.I am anEgyptian who participated in th rovloution and who exposed to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to Indonesia I believe that Egyptians will be able to create their model and that we will be on a much better position than what do you expect . Before the revolution , many Egyptians were working alone but now we are working in large groups searching for synergies and building on each other . I believe that the positive attitude and the team work will move us to a very advanced place . I dream to have one of Egyptian ubiversities in the list of of top 500 and to live on a duble our space in 10 years and I believe that we can reach the Turkey economic success . <p> Monarchies do not become nicer as time moves on . They either die , become furniture or rule stricture . Since all people are inherently evil , they will lean back on what they know best , evil , when they are confronted . With this stated the opposite course of action will take place with the rich countries , they will become the centers of violence , if they are not already . <p> With all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask one living in 1911 to predict the future of the USA one hundred years out than to predict the future of the Middle East just ten years from now . <p> Of course , unless one has been living under a rock should know this guy Zakaria usually comes across hitting the nail on head with a sledgehammer . <p> In my humble opinion he is correct with Saudi Arabia being the 800 pound gorilla , not Israel . Israel is only the 400 pound gorilla ... wake up folks . <p> I like how Farid mentions the Arab countries that do nt produce oil . Obviously the western influence is only limited to countires like the US and France and GB only solving humanitarian crisises . Being from Bangladesh i cant really imagine arab countries that do nt produce oil . Obviously the humanitarian crisis , comes from the repression that Farid mentions . But at the heart of it all , these are the real Arab countries without the Western Oil crisis . Let Democracy find its path , even though the path is meandering . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fareed as usual caters to the Zionist school of doomed analysis . The Muslim world now numbers close to 2 BILLION very young , increasingly educated and very angry people who have been colonized , demonized and ripped off by neo-imperialist west ( which itself is headed for socio-economic oblivion as power shifts to Asia ) and run by corrupt and out of touch governments like the rotten House of Saud who have western backing . The imposition of unsustainable Zionist cancer in Palestine has only made matters worse . The fact is that almost all " predictions " about the largely Islamic Asia Minor ( Middle-East is a misnomer ) have proved false over the years . The future will be shaped by powerful nations like Iran , Turkey and perhaps Egypt if it shakes off US shackles . Time will tell but do n't hold yoour breath about Fareed 's sophomoric made for CNN/FOX future predictions and chai khaneh ( tea house ) gossip . <p> The middle east is on the path to a Khalifa and is become more fundamentally inclined and turning more toward Islam . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete moron , or he has a more pernicious agenda . <p> The idea of an 10th century pre technological Islamic caliphate may make ignorant Muslims feel better psychologically but it will lead to deeper and deeper poverty because it will not be able to provide enough good jobs to support for the massive population of the Caliphate . The Caliphate will also trigger non ceasing conflicts and wars between various nationalities and tribes in the Arab world <p> who 's this guy trying to kid . in 10 years everything will be the same with different faces running the show having their strings pulled by grumpy old bearded men who talk to god on a walkie talkie. that entire region isnt going anywhere till they stop marrying their girl children off to their first cousins so they 're all inbred , wasting 1/2 the day praying to nonexistent things for nonexistant things , and the other half of the day engaging in martyrdom operations . nothing in this region will change till they stop acting like it 's still 800AD . <p> I have yet to find many examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what he 's talking about , so I would n't pay much serious attention to his latest prognostications . He 's nothing more than a self-important , self-styled Expert on Everything who really knows very little about very little . Go back &; read his columns on Iraq from 2004 to 2007 , for example ... <p> my thoughts are in line with yours in almost all cases except Saudi Arabia(SA) . Actually , I think SA will not make it through as a one country in 10 years . There is no succession plan for roles , and you have more than 10 thousand princes fighting with each other over power . The level of income is coming down and people becoming poorer and poorer . Plus , SA population include highly educated people in prisons while the religious party has the power over media , education , justice system , and many other governmental agencies . I can assure you that this party is smallest , but the most influential party . Plus , you have Shia in the eastern province lying on the sources of oil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrest in Bahrain where most that concern Shia in the eastern province of SA . If the unrest continues in Bahrain , the unrest will reach the eastern province of SA . In fact , there are still small scale protest in eastern province powered by what is happening in Bahrain . <p> Farid , what were you to say if Syria , as a state , disintegrated , and numerous states arose in its place ? You recently wrote an article saying that this is what is happening in Libya ... you did n't view it as a bad thing . Now , I ask you , what happens if that happens in Syrai ? <p> My experience in the middle east was the discovery that if you want to understand the middle east , you must understand Israel and Palestine . Zakaria does n't seem put either into his equation and i feel that this ca n't be brushes aside . I do like his article though even though I think that Saudi Arabia is already using heavy military force . They have proved that they do more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were very quick to send troops and equipment next door for example .... just to provide a firewall between them and their neighbors who are raising up and wanting peace . This middle east awakening and this story has not even begun yet . I believe that this could be the start of world war three and no one even knows that yet . Perhaps a bit gloomy but the big players have n't stepped into the ring yet . There is one axiom in this world . Energy drives everything . Huge opportunities will be available to any powerful country that can step in to fill the space . Someone always has . <p> The problems in the Arab nations are almost entirely a product of a massive population explosion , and the utter inability of any government there to provide enough jobs for the younger generation . You can blame dictators or Israel for the plight of the Arabs but in fact it is an entirely predictable result of demographics . Arab nations should start a China like program of birth control or they will sink deeper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are leaving the Arab countries for the West which only worsens the problems . I suggest a rapprochement between Arabs and Israel since the Jews have many skills and aptitudes in science and technology that will be extremely useful for the advancement of the entire Middle East . It is one way to stimulate the economies of many Arab nations and increase the available skilled and technological jobs for the younger generation . <p> Mr. Zakaria , I kind of agreeing with some of what u said , Look at Germany and Japan , both came very strong economically and democratically after WW2 , u mentioned Endonisia as a model for Egypt to follow , or the turkish example for democratic and economic advances . I 'm Christian from Egypt , the strong Religious and islamic fundamental mentality and extremist radical views in life together with intolerance to others even the libral muslims , not to mention there intolerence to the western Ideas and to Christians in general will destroy the economy and will kill the Tourism and foreign investiment . Yes the people who started the revolution againist Mubarak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamic Brotherhood and the Salafi groups was afraid , but once the revolution succeded , they took over . Religion is a very sensitive and appealing factor in determining who will be in charge in Egypt . With 40% of the population is illeterate and 80% are ignorant politically , then it is very easy to controll them by the extremist groups . I hate to say , But I can assure u and remember my words Egypt is going in a dark tunnel of poverty , religious clensing and extremist controlling every way of life . Most egyptians now are asking for a government with a Religious islamic bases <p> I noted no mention of the role of the U.S .. I hope this was intended and not an oversight . We are a debtor nation with lots of serious problems , so it does n't make sense for us to keep doling out money to corrupt governments that do n't like us anyway . We need to get out of the Middle East completely and let the countries of the region , including Israel , determine their own destinies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internally and with each other , as they have for thousands of years . Nothing we or any western nation can do has ever changed that and never will . <p> Fareed enjoy your show . You are probably correct in your analysis . Syria might have the toughest road due to violence . Saudi Arabia will likely be slower but over time might evolve towards democracy after the remaining Middle Eastern countries have changed . Good luck to them all . <p> Once again my former countryman and our ISLAMIC SYMPATHIZER Mr. FAREED ZAKARIA proves my point that I have written about quite extensively now . He almost sounds like a SOOTHE SAYER spewing out HIS ROSY ISLAMIC PROPHECIES to GULLIBLE AMERICANS ! ! ! <p> WHAT Mr.ZAKARIA WILL NEVER FAIL TO DO : <p> ( a ) Continue to put a SOFT FACE on Islamic radicalism in his ONGOING QUEST to sell Islam . <p> ( b ) Continue to urge already magnanimous Americans to be even more tolerant and understanding of Muslims , open the doors for greater Muslim migration , EMBRACE Muslim Turkey into the European Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , but in reality opening the doors for MASS MUSLIM migration into EU &; America to alter their dominant Christian ethos for ever ! ) , and allow building of even more MEGA mosques ( like the 53,000 sq.ft . Mosque for 200 Muslim families in Murfreesboro , the ground zero VICTORY Mosque APTLY named CARDOBA in memory of the Muslim conquest of Spain &; the demolishing of a magnificent Church to build a Mega Mosque -- Any similarities here ! ? ! ) . <p> ( c ) Even greater freedoms for Muslims including in allowing them to wearing the burka &; lenient security checks at a/ps ( impacting the nation 's security ) , and praying rights at work places , halal meat etc. ( adding to the already inefficient American industry ) , greater understanding of Muslim student 's sentiments at schools , public places etc. including ASTOUNDINGLY opposition to the display of CHRISTMAS TREES , or PRAYING IN THE NAME OF GOD etc. ( to ensure that Islamic way of life becomes more mainstream to dent our dominant Christian ethos ) . etc. etc . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The PLIGHT OF THE HELPLESS FAST VANISHING MINORITY CHRISTIANS &; others who have lived for 1000 's of years in these UNFORTUNTATE Muslim nations . These include basic human rights such as a quiet/peaceful place to pray , stoppage of demolition of their Churches/Temples etc. , elimination of one-sided BLASPHEMY laws , unfair taxes , basic human dignity &; security . ( Who knows he may take some cue here , and pay SOME LIP SERVICE going forward ! ) . <p> ( b ) While doing PR work on behalf of these so-called Muslim democracies , many of which are democratic and MORE IMPORTANTLY SECULAR ONLY ON PAPER , with brute Muslim majorities making it IMPOSSIBLE to vent minority grievances ( which Mr. Zakaria talks about ) . <p> Etc. etc . <p> WHILE KEEPING THE ABOVE IN PERSPECTIVE , here are some notable quotes from Mr. Zakaria 's PROPHECIES in his own words with some of the CATCHY WORDS capitalized and WITHIN BRACKETS my words that Mr. ZAKARIA CONVENIENTLY FORGOT ! ! ! . ( Readers please note ! ) : <p> 1 ) " A number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iReport about " MY PREDICTIONS " for the Middle East ten years down the line . ( Sounds like a SOOTHE SAYER to me ! ) <p> 2 ) " The big caveat , however , is that the Middle East is not ( CHRISTIAN ) Eastern Europe . So change will not happen on the scale or with the speed and scope that it happened in Europe . <p> 3 ) " The Middle East governments have used two methods of control -- MASS REPRESSION and MASS BRIBERY . " ( ALLUDING to OVERT &; COVERT US support for middle eastern dictatorships , stealing of their oil wealth etc. which Mr. Zakaria has discussed at great length on several occasions , ESSENTIALLY laying the blame at AMERICA 's DOORSTEP for the STUPIDITY of these people mired NOT in democracy &; progress BUT MEDEIVAL RELIGIOUS EUPHORIA ! ) . <p> 4 ) " Eventually there will be KINDLER , GENTLER monarchies that spread the wealth around more . ( Does it also apply to their helpless MINORITIES Mr. Zakaria ? ) <p> 5 ) " In terms of Egypt : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the Muslim Brotherhood whom you NEVER TIRE of proclaiming as MODERATE &; PROGRESSIVE sit in your prophecies Mr.Zakaria ? ) . <p> 6 ) " It ( Indonesia ) was poor . It HAD the dangers of Islamic fundamentalism , extremism and jihadi groups . ( Is Indonesia even largely free of Islamic radicalism today Mr. Zakaria ? Have Americans forgotten the celebrations on the streets of Jakarata after 9/11 ? Or the spate of attacks on western targets there ? ) . <p> 7 ) " But the DEMOCRATIC political system STABILIZED the country . It provided VENTS and ESCAPE VALVES for some of these TENSIONS . " ( REALLY ! ! ! ! Why do n't you talk about the plight of minorities there Mr.Zakaria ? And what kind of VENTS do they have apart from getting killed Mr.Zakaria ? ) . <p> 8 ) " There were hiccups along the way . Indonesia is still a pretty complicated place with a lot of corruption , dysfunction and SOME PROBLEMS of Islamic extremism . But , BY AND LARGE , it has been a stable democratic country with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This is EXACTLY the way you HOODWINK Gullible Americans by making some broad statements to SHOWCASE your views as FAIR &; BALANCED , while the CAMOUFLAGED MESSAGE is vastly different ! ) . <p> 9 ) " it would be AMAZING PROGRESS for the country ( Egypt ) . It would be MORE PROGRESS in 10 years THAN THEY HAVE MADE IN 40 YEARS . ( REALLY SO , Mr.Zakaria ? You have termed Mr.Mubarak as a CORRUPT American STOOGE even as the Egyptian economy was growing at between 6-8% all these years ... something that Muslim nations could only dream of ! ! And ASTOUNDINGLY you LIED when you called the Israeli-Egyptian peace deal as AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO REGIMES &; NOT BETWEEN THEIR PEOPLES with YOUR COVERT AIM of RESURRECTING the HOSTLITY of the DOMINANT ( &; now DORMANT ! ) Arab adversary against TINY ISRAEL , inline with the Hamas inspired Arab &; Iranian game-plan of BANISHING the Jews from that land YET AGAIN ! ! ! <p> A lot of Americans have already seen through your game Mr.Zakaria , INSPITE of your Yale credentials , dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India 's tolerant Hindu majority ! ) . BTW , even Afia Siddiqui was MIT educated ! <p> " 1 ) " A number of you have been asking me on Facebook , Twitter and iReport about " MY PREDICTIONS " for the Middle East ten years down the line . ( Sounds like a SOOTHE SAYER to me , and I would also replace the word PREDICTIONS by PRETENSIONS ! ) . <p> Fareed makes a great living lecturing to Arab and Muslim and college groups all over the world . Who do you think is paying him ? His job is to defend Islam and gently agitate against Israel to avoid losing his CNN gig . The real problem in the Middle East is that the Arabs are dealing with a population tsunami , and they can not make enough jobs for all the young people which inevitably leads to unrest and rebellion . <p> Getting rid of Israel will change absolutely nothing for the Arab masses . They will just have one less scapegoat to scream about . Turning to war against Israel will be incredibly expensive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with Israel to create high tech jobs and upgrade their sciences . All the noise coming out of the Arab apologists like Fareed is just useless noise that will not improve the lot of the Arabs . They need to deal with their population explosion , and need to keep the radical Islamists in check because they will bring nothing but poverty , ignorance and internecine warfare to the Arabs and Muslim world . <p> April 23 , 2011 at 10:58 am <p> Will-Atlanta-USA <p> @ Amit from Atlanta : Your post is really boring , lengthy and jumping up and down to different issues but mainly bashing Islam using all the usual stereotypical claims . You are trying to sound like the defender of the Judeo-Christian values and interests ( yeah sure , that always sells in the good old USA ) . Cleverly stuffing your arguments with statements that appease to the majority in this country and feed the rampant Islamophobia among regular Americans . I have no idea where the likes of you get the audacity to believe that ALL regular Americans are so stupid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a friendlier crowd if you post your ingenious revelations in sites frequented by the lovers of Limbaugh , Hannity , Boortz or Beck . While I do understand the fact that you as a Hindu have a lot of misconceptions against Islam , you should try to at least balance your posts to show some common sense . Sanity usually prevails or so I hope ! . <p> I also largely disagree with Boortz , and even more so with Limbaugh , and Beck again even on Muslim issues . <p> Having said that I am a GREAT GREAT FAN of some of Pakistan 's most well known MUSLIM columnists Irfan Husain , Nadeem Paracha , Kamran Shafi , I A Rehman , and Mahir Ali and two thers non-Muslims ( Parsis ) Cyril Almeida , Ardeshir Cowasjee and GET MOST OF MY INFO even on Islam , Pakistan , Islamic terror , etc. from PAKISTAN 's #1 English Daily Dawn , and AGREE WITH EVERY WORD they say even on these topics ! <p> Just check out the links below and skim through just the titles , which themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by far the MOST ENLIGHTENED , PRAGMATIC , MUSLIMS I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS . The only other Indian Muslims that can come anywhere close to these PAKISTANI GEMS are India 's former president Abdul Kalaam , Azim Premji , and A R Rehman ( who BTW was a Hindu until recently ! ) . <p> http : **25;6705;TOOLONG <p> Likewise I am also a STRONG OPPONENT of America unjust Iraq war , and NOW the Af-Pak war and favor PULLING our troops out of these conflicts and letting the Muslims manage their own affairs ONLY to go back if ever they conspire against America , Europe , India or any other country in the FREE WORLD . <p> Let me know what you have to say now ! <p> Amit-Atlanta-USA <p> April 23 , 2011 at 1:18 pm <p> Amit-Atlanta-USA <p> Anyone interested check out the following CNN-GPS link for some energetic discussion on ISLAM , AF-PAK ISSUE ( incl. negotiating with the Taliban ) , drone attacks , etc. here . <p> There are some aspects of the Indonesian model that Egypt could emulate , democratic institutions , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a less extreme teaching of islam . However one of the main " vents and escape values " is ethnic and religious conflcit . One of the main reasons that international terrorist organizations have not made more inroads into Indonesia , is that potential recruits place a higher priority in attacking the ethnic or religious group , often Christian , down the road . This is part of the Indonesian model that does n't need to be exported . <p> Perhaps one element that should be addressed in the coming years is the use of force , and who has control of it . Will it be possible to shift toward a more equitable system which favors law enforcement , while decreasing the scope of unilateral military intervention ? <p> Do n't worry thanks to the CRUSADE of people like Mr.Zakaria , that 's well taken care of ................ many of thsoe people will be in Europe &; America . The FLOOD GATES of Muslim migration will be opened as &; when ( NOT IF ) MUSLIM Turkey is allowed into the EU . Mr. Zakaria is trying VALIANTLY to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ONE GPS-transcript where he does everything in HIS COVERT AGENDA bash America , Europe , Israel to his heart 's content , and suppor the Islamists ! ! While he does that in literally everyone of his articles , this is one of the best . As always , with Mr.Zakaria 's articles you need to take care to read between the lines , with special attention to what he ( deliberately doe NOT say at all , otherwise you succumb to the overall design thinking that it 's all fair &; balanced ! ! ! <p> As food prices continue to increase world wide , Egypt will have a difficult importing more food . Egypt has to import half of the food that they eat . There will be food riots and turmoil in Egypt . I do n't see democracy taking root and growing in that environment . The Egyptians will remember the 40 year rule of Murabarak as the time when they food to eat . <p> A drastic change could happen if Muslim countries allow freedom of religion ( proselytism ) . As long as Islam constitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , perhaps some cosmetic changes , but in general , everything will remain the same . I do n't understand why Muslims do not convert to any of the Middle Eastern Christian Traditions , they offer much better moral , ethical and life standards than Islam . <p> With the exception of Libya and Syria , I think the Mideast will look pretty much the same a decade from now . What could change the oil-rich countries is a lack of demand for oil , but even if the US and Western Europe somehow wean themselves from Mideast oil , there is always China and India , both of whom will need massive imports to fill their needs . So , Saudi Arabia et . al . will continue and I disagree with the notion that Saudi Arabia will somehow mellow out . Power and greed are hard habits for the royal family to overcome . <p> Fareed , you mention two ways that Arab dictatorships have controlled the population , but there clearly are 3 : Bribery -- by sharing the oil wealth if they have it Repression -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely and Distraction -- allowing people a single venting option , giant rallies to condemn Israel and Jews . <p> Only now with the increased spread of communication technology and the internet , it has become nearly impossible to keep the 3rd method , Distraction by Venting against Israel and Jews , from morphing naturally into what they really want to vent about , which is Repression of themselves by their own governments and the subsequent lack of economic opportunity . <p> The proof of this 3rd method of control and how it really was simply Deliberate Distraction is that you did n't see huge rallies in Tahrir Square of people holding signs bashing Israel and pleading for Palestinians . The signs were about their own plight , that they have been forced for 50 years to be silent about . <p> You do n't see huge rallies in Syria about reclaiming the Golan Heights from Israel , do you ? No , it is all about reclaiming their own rights as humans . Syrians only protested about the Golan because it was the only thing they were allowed to vent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Israel and Jews . Fareed , you need to acknowledge and incorporate it into your discussion . <p> 10 years from now ? Try to look to september this year when the UN will say YES to the Palestinian state . A new Israeli -Arabs war will start shortly and ALL the muslim country in the region will " forget " their revolutions.They have to " defend " themthelves from the bloody zionists So bye-bye " Arab democracy " for another 10 years ......... because of Israel off course ............. <p> As always , Zakaria is very perceptive , very astute . Always fascinating to read him . My real concern about all the uprisings is that all too often in the past revolutions have a way of not turning out for the better of the people - there have been successful revolts but we 'll all have to see how these uprisings play out in the end . I do hope the best for the people of the Middle East ; they certainly would benefit from living in democratic regimes with equality for all - women included . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle east finds it 's way to freedom and stability . I hope the US does n't get involved along the way . We have a great track record of screwing things up . Our politicians spend billions/trillions in the process . The indigenous people hate us in the end . Do n't forget we supported Osama Binladen when he too was a rebel fighting for freedom . <p> It will be a hot place full of primitive minded people doing primitive things .... just like it has been for centuries . Hopefully one day the human race can break from it 's self imposed prison of religion . <p> I see a one world government coming out of all this . Not good . Get right with God . John 3:16 is so overquoted , but hits the nail on the head . Believe in Jesus , because these things have been prophesied and are coming to pass and will pass . <p> Check out " theodorenmichele " channel on YouTube . That 's only one of the many channels out there with prophesies coming true . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give enough credit to its potential for real change . Not only was it the start of this Arab uprising , it remains unique in several respects and potentially more capable of reforms than Egypt and all other Arab places mentioned in the commentary . First , it is an educated society albeit one in which jobs are a problem for graduates leading to considerable frustration . But with political reforms , the economy should be able to innovate through the inevitable messiness of building democratic institutions . Places like the Tunis School of Business and the Mediterranen Business School will put out talented business grads ready to engage in international trade and perhaps even bring Americans over to discover tourism along the coast , a fact that Europeans have known for decades . Tunisia can benefit from ' soft power ' initiatives even more than other countries in the region in such undertakings as as Partners For A New Beginning , headed by former Secretary Albright and supported by Walter Isaacson and other Americans with a great deal of money and influence . For the United States , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Americanism has never been a big issue . Another important distinguishing feature of Tunisia is its secularism . With democracy , this could be put to the test as now there are 50 political parties , a few Islamic-based though apparently moderate right now , so a big-tent reform seems to be in the future as the country heads to elections in July . Tunisia benefits from French influence in a manner that Egypt does n't know from its experiences with Europe . France has compelling interests and could easily partner with American and Italian partners . Tunisia should also be lauded for its promotion of women 's equality . It 's not nearly what it is in Europe or America but certainly light years ahead of other places in the region . Tunisia has the potential to be a beacon of hope for real democratic reforms and while attention has focused so much on Egypt , this country where a fruit and vegetable street vendor took his life rather than continue to suffer daily indignities at the hands of police , flooded the imaginations of people in the region . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that the Middle East has avoided cultural change -- much like Japan prior to WWII -- or China till recently -- when we look a Europe of today , there is tremendous resistance to cultural change -- similarly , there are parts of the US where cultural change proves difficult . As for true freedom , it is a difficult matter -- today opinion in the US is less free -- by that I imply that there is an overwillingness to thrust a dominant opinion -- simply put , Opinion = Media loudness . We do n't think Ben Wederman represents the Libyan people -- but unfortunately that is what we are forced to live with . CNN represents itself -- Cooper and Morgan mostly represent themselves as do you . But I think that there is a case for an alternative newsmedia -- that should be the goal of social media -- and ultimately -- large News wallahs should not be preaching their stuff . <p> Zakaria , unfortunately you know nothing about politics , I am Saudi and Proud and love our royal family , every citizen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth , it is saudi tradition that we respect and love our leaders and they do the same , I am not going to tell you what our goverment has done for us but an important point is that our leaders pay us to study , we do get salaries in the schools just to encourgae us to study , tell me any one of western countries do the same , it is just and example , enjoy your freedom and leave us alone please <p> hey fareed what is the aim in regards to reforming the entire world to the united states ideology of democracy ? What are the benefits ? Democracy is a zoo where folks can run rampid in lust and desires . Is not possible for a nation to partake in a government that is based on religious text and it be acceptable to the us ? what about mexico ? It is filled with criminals , terrorist , and drug cartels is mexico safe from the americas punch ? <p> There is a HUGE difference with Indonesia , Indonesian are generally peaceful all the bad elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indonesia but have anyone stop to think and calculate all the cost and expense of running the country when the tax collector will steal the country blind ? Suharto no doubt had parceled out concession to so call cronies , this goes for regional generals and officials also . Please tell me how much will it cost to operate , train , maintain for a fighter jet , a tank , a frigette ... all the troops and officers ? All these are paid for by Suharto 's so claimed corruption money ! Suharto 's resources usually 1/3 profit of all business that received concessions , to me it sure looked like tax collection in his name but actually for the country ! I however am sure his children are extremely dirty . As for all the generals and officals are given 2 years in office to collect all they can as bonus or retirement fund . Is that dirty , I do n't know ...... <p> Zakaria , with respect to your analysis and opinion , I think you missed it . What has been germinating for more then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Western supported tyrants who have completely silenced the voice of the Arabic streets to the extend that Israel was receiving unconditional support by even the Arabic League via their American puppets such as Moubarak , Abdallah and the Monarchs . Well ten years from now the whole Middle-East is poised to change toward a more aggressive stance at what Israel does with the Palestinian state . The new generation is not going to observe the continued atrocities committed in Palestine . Read my mind and wait to see ! <p> HI FAREED , I beilieve you are very close in what you are saying . I also believe that if you do not see some type of reform in Saudi Arabia it will be very unlikely that you will see any type of reform in any of the other oil producing countries for the simple fact like you say , they are the 800 LB Gorrilla in the middle east . <p> I would like to ask Fareed -- what is the ideal country that all these middle eastern countries should aspire towards ? Should they all be like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember you are saying yes to these countries having all the problems that the Unites States has as well -- huge dept problems , constant military interventions and blind support of one and only one chosen country out of the entire middle east -- due to ethno- religious affiliations ? <p> Really Fareed , what is the best country in the world , tell us , with a few minor modifications all the countries of the world could make that system their own . our own . <p> Why not take a more realistic view , for incremental and steady improvements in human rights and poverty alleviation for each of these nations and let them forget their own way forward , God help them ? <p> I agree with you that change in Middle East will come slowly , because the people might not be quite ready for democracy . But the clamor for freedom and change seem to be genuine . I grew up in Kuwait , and even went to Arabic school there . Even if you speak a little Arabic , and eat some of their food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like us , and they want the same things in life like freedom , happiness , prosperity and so on . Just give them time . So , Inshallah , democracy will come to the Middle East . The work has just begun . <p> It 's funny that Fareed forgot to mention anything about Turkey . Turkey is the regions fastest growing and largest economy , it 's a huge energy hub that connects a whole host of gas pipelines from the Middle East- Balkans- Central Asia- Russia into Europe , its military is undergoing a massive military modernization program that will leave Turkey with the largest and most technologically developed Air force and Navy in the Middle East and amongst the largest in Europe by the end of the decade , its on the fast track to developing a large number of nuclear power plants , and Turkey 's political clout is enormous . In fact , Yemen 's opposition group just recently named its politically party after that of the current Turkish government 's party ( The Justice and Development Party ) . My prediction is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be playing some major clean up . Given Turkeys close and warm relationship with the regions Jewry ( Jewish Population ) for the last 600 years this can be a good or bad thing for Israel . We will have to wait and see . <p> That will definetly be interesting to see . So many things can happen in 10 years . I heard Turkey dropped the stealth fighter jet program with Korea . What I am hearing now is that they are going with Brazil , Italy or even possibly Japan . So Turkey has like 116 Stealth figher jets sitting on hold plus another 100-200 . The only AF in the region with stealth fj 's is Israel but even they are only ordering 20 . Turkey is ordering like 200-300 . When you got Arabs , Israel , Russia and Greece on youre borders I guess you are allowed to be paranoid . lol . <p> the person begging on the street ? college graduates ca n't even get jobs . Next time you see someone begging in the street , lend him your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; do your deed and see if he gets hired . If not , take him to WalMart to see if he gets hired . If he ca n't read , then tutor him and then help him get a job if you think it 's as easy as saying " get a job " <p> THERE IS A GENOCIDE TAKING PLACE UNDER ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC WATCH ! ! ! ! ! Obama is too busy making believe he is a christian while endorsing election frauds by the UN and Hillary ex .... the Ivory Coast in favor of Allasane Ouattara . Since then only 2-3 weeks ago , that candidate ( Allssane Ouattara -- another Muslim , not wrong with them , except for this one ) has been on a killing spree to eradicate all Christians in that country . The Ivory Coast is the largest Christian nation in Africa ( At least it use to be ) The massacre perpetrated by Allassane Ouattara ( http : **34;6732;TOOLONG ... Images are graphic . The puppet that Obama try to legitimize through a congratulation speech . ( ( **38;6768;TOOLONG ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslims conversion to any other religion except Islam . Around the world , the same problems arise in places with Muslim communities . I believe the key to make it happen could be all the Middle Eastern Christian churches that share the same language and culture than Muslims except ethical and moral values . If these churches try more aggressively to convert their Muslim brethren , many conflicts could be drastically diminished . <p> The oil rich countries will face a different set of pressures . Stuffing money into the pockets of millions of young people without providing meaningful employment opportunities , create frustrations on a grand scale . Underemployed mass harboring such frustrations could lead to them demanding a much biggerr say in how a country is run . In such a scenario , no amount oil money might be able to keep the lid on . With Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries beginning to look like modern states , the Gulf countries will look hopelessly anachronistic and for Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries which have a bulge of under thirties population , the feeling of being left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the South Asian nations grow more prosperous , the easy life built on exploited labor will will begin to be a thing of the past . Another headache for the rulers . <p> It 's interesting reading comments . Most are from a bunch of losers that have no idea and are just a bunch of idiots . Some make some good points . Unfortunately most of you are ignorant and dumb and really should just go back in the caves where you came from . It may take longer than ten years but I believe the middle east , especially egypt with it educated population will be a better place to live and eventually they will all live in harmony and peace -- including israel . <p> Yesterday I saw Fox History Channel . One American lady went to Saudi Arabia and she openly supporting their ( Saudi ) taliban terrorism , if she have real guts she may support that terrorism in U.S. The U.S joined the Saudi Arabia in G-20 , why U.S did'nt join the Afghanistan in G-20 , because both Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox History channel . One American lady went to Saudi Arabia and she openly supporting their ( saudi ) taliban Terrorism . If she have real guts she may support that terrorism in U.S. ! ! ! ! ! <p> If sane people on all sides do not stand up for what is just and put the effort to change , we are all doomed ! After all we are all brothers with the same FATHER ; ABRAHAM ; if we do not come together in peace there will be an enemy that comes along and threatens all of or lives and our children and their childrens , childrens , we will turn to nothing , be nothing for the ones that are left will be starving slaves , with no hope , no rest and no peace ! ! So it is time that we all work together for the common good of all of us ! We must destroy all vesteges of real evil to have any hope of coninuing to live our lives , we must seek out all evil and then we can love our familes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can put forth . WE ARE ALL FROM THE SAME FAMILY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> I do n't think it is possible to overstate the impact of modern Technology -- especially in a region as YOUNG as the Middle East . Those born just a generation ago lived largely in relative isolation . After WWII it was TV that gave America a NATIONAL identity -- before it had been many REGIONAL identities . The New Generation simply OUTNUMBER the older Generation in the MIDEAST -- The Modern World connecting them through their CELL PHONES and other Ubiquitous Technology to a shared Global Identity that will make the old ideas simply IRRELEVANT to the world in which we all live . <p> Fareed Zakaria , though a follower of islam by name , knows little or nothing about the islamic world . Human beings being human beings , where ever one goes , and that includes the middle east , are basically the same in SPRIT AND DEED . Referring to political changes in the middle east &; africa , ( especially islamic countries ) one only has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert kingdoms . It is a very basic concept that human beings of what faith long for freedom . ( the very reason that brought FAREED ZAKARIA TO USA AND NOT TO SAUDI ARABIA . ) Yes the right now the desert kingdoms are spending their huge built up reserves to keep their chairs , but not for very long . Sooner than later people being what they are , their memories being short lived , will ask for more and more till freedom is attained . Many may not even know what freedom is . But freedom is a fire that can not be put out by affulence or water . So very soon , you will see the downfall of the regimes ruling the states of the GULF COOPERATIVE COUNCIL , WHICH COMPRIMISE OF SAUDI ARABIA , KUWAIT , UAE , OMAN , BAHRAIN AND THE LIKE . So Mr. Fareed Zakaria get ready to eat your own words . <p> Fareed- I liked your excellent analysis about the revolution versus evolution when it comes to non-oil regimes and oil rich regimes respectively . you hit nail on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever the path of this sweeping political uprising would be in the region , I am not optimistic about the changes towards democracy and freedom for the people . I see more of a transition to what happened to Pakistan over the last few decades . The political process of Pakistan kept moving back and forth between democracy to military rule with no freedom for men and women ; and no economic and social independence . I see Egypt might move to the same direction as it happened in Pakistan . As long as the so called Shariah Laws prevail in those Muslim countries , there will be no real freedom for the people towards economic prosperity and social development for all . I hope the transition towards democracy will also include the establishment of secularism in near future . That is the only way to see the real freedom for the people in those countries . <p> Fareed : " The Middle East governments have used two methods of control -- mass repression and mass bribery . The oil-rich countries use mass bribery . Countries like Syria use mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders have opted for repression . That tinderbox is arguably the most important in the region , but you did n't mention it . Is it just assumed that it 's going to topple , or do we like to forget what the brave Iranian people are going through there ? <p> " The problem is that Americans want low-taxes and lots of government services . " <p> This is one of the most insidious and dishonest lies Zakaria incessantly purports . The bottom line is this : the current state of economic affairs is reflective of a growing and entrenched super-class which lives in an entirely different world than what we would consider the " middle and upper-middle " classes ( doctors , engineers , mechanics , scientists , machinists , and other productive professionals ) . Forget about the poor for a moment ; the super-class is now parasitically sucking out money from the most productive classes of society that are responsible for everything you see around you that makes society progress : competent doctors , science , technology , comfort , etc . The economic crisis in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep their unsustainable wealth models which rely upon not paying the majority of capital to productive labor . This is why Zakaria will boldly claim that Western engineers and professionals are " spoiled rotten " for wanting to own their own homes while the " real " cost of labor is akin to the slave-wages paid to Chinese employees of big multi-nationals . These sycophants then have the audacity to purport to the general public that they desire to " raise " the standards of third-world poverty stricken humans . This is doublespeak . What they really mean is they want to lower the standard of the professional classes in the Western world , particularly in the United States . <p> Every single piece of verbal nonsense Zakaria defecates from his foul mouth is a promulgation of policy which benefits and sustains these finance oligarchs of the world at the expense of " Main Street " professionals and the educated and productive classes of society . He is a spokesperson from plutocracy and for plutocracy . <p> Government services are scraps compared to the astronomical budget of the military industrial complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of unregulated international financial institutions . Fareed should talk about the real problem instead of pinning the blame of everything on the " evil , fat , spoiled , and lazy westerner " who , God forbid , wants to earn a wage which he/she can support him/her self and their families with . God forbid he/she spends 3-7 years in post graduate education to be paid only marginally better than those without such an education . God forbid we actually have a " meritocracy " . <p> Fareed goes on to write : " If you look at the recent polls , most Americans think there should be no changes to Medicare and no broad increases in taxation . This is magical mathematics . " <p> Let 's talk about " magical mathematics " Fareed . <p> " Magical mathematics " is a system of fractional reserve banking , owned by a private financial cartel , which can create money by monetizing debt , and then make trillions in profit by interest without adding one atoms weight of productivity to society . " Magical mathematics " are taking billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to the wives of Wall Street bankers who then buy up student loans with zero risk . This bailout -- 220 million . " Magical mathematics " are the continuation of billion dollar bonuses and the ongoing transfer of wealth from the productive , creative , and educated classes to the financial oligarchs of the world . Its wages , you stupid , stupid man . <p> Why is it , Mr. Zakaria , that you , time and time again , fail to acknowledge the fact that the wealthiest billionaires of the world have seen their wealth increase many times over in the past 10 years , while technology and productivity increased exponentially due to the creative contributions of education professional workers , YET , those very same professional workers have been marginalized and paid less and less ? <p> Magical mathematics are to somehow create a sustainable and prosperous world which rewards meritocracy and education while still having the worlds " super-class " keep getting richer . Corporate profits must be delivered to the most productive workers . The super-rich , simply , can not be getting richer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be different in 10 years -- hmmm .. a couple hundred million illiterate people with no skills living in the 8th century ........ I think it will be the same . Only Obama can say things like " we can liberate the great people of Afghanistant and unleash their true greatness " and some drool over his pablem -- 50% of the men ca n't read and ditto for 90% of the women , seems like they probably have a bright future competing against other people . <p> All of these countries want freedom but have absolutely nothing to offer . Very similar to the growing portion of a America who wants more from the government . <p> My two cents ! LOL , there 'll never be a so called Palestinian state . #1. there is not such thing as ' Palestinians , Arafat the swindler schemer invented this scam died with an estate $1.2Billion- your clue to what this ia really all about . Extortion racket. #2 . Israel ca n't afford to risk surrender of airspace to a sovereign nation , with offensive air capabilty- given the track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Logistics , there is n't enough land , water and resources to support a growing viable so called Palestinian nation- albeit split in two different places , Gaza and West Bank . So , where do these stupid people belong ? Why are they stupid ? Simple . They think " getting stuff for free " is a brilliant deal , having their kids taught jihad , and hate is smart , their not good people . History has clearly documented Israel as the eternal homeland of the Jews , and that the JEWS are even willing to share parts of their ancestral homeland with a so called Palestinian people is sufficient to demonstrate the kindness , tolerance and compassion the Jews have for a displaced people . NO OTHER NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD would do such a thing . Now , it 's time for these so called ingrateful Palestinians to move back to Jordan . Where they represent over 50% of the population and the Queen is Palestinian . <p> Ohhh here it goes ... and then the retorn ... God this sounds so lame after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a waste of brain cells to read through this garbage and then the cliche retort , and the the retort 's retort ... blah blah . <p> There are lots of lies such as the so-called Palestanians which have been PERPETUATED into the American psyche . <p> People like Mr. Zakaria who are otherwise smart , intelligent , highly educated and deeply knowledgeable in Muslim affairs know this clearly well , but will continue to orchestrate these , b'coz they clearly have an ISLAMIC AGENDA ! <p> Egypt will lead the change in MENA region ( Middle East &; North Africa ) . They have shown the maturity ( non-violant protest , army not firing on its populace , and regime making its exit ) and are capable to build a strong country on democratic principles , more akin to Turkey rather than Indonesia . I am very positive of this turn of events and look forward to the entire Islamic world turning away from monarchies . <p> I live in Israel and wonder about the Israeli Arabs and how their society is developing . I recently produced this video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women are challenging the conservative Arab society and the discriminating Jewish labor market : http : **35;6808;TOOLONG ... <p> In saying the following I am not trying to claim an imperialist ownership of the revolutions in Arab countries but simply point out that they are reflective of a world wide trend occurring not only in Arab countries seeking fundamental political system change but as a part of the broader world disillusionment with current political process from the ground up . <p> What has captured the imagination of the world regards the Arab revolutions is a perception of ' common goals , common aspirations ' inherent within the ' youthful energy for political reform ' and calls for ' Democracy and Freedom ' from oppressive political elites is the resonance with disillusionment of citizens within existing Western Democracies . Which is why there is overwhelming support for what is occurring . <p> One only has to look at the election of Obama and the rhetoric he used to gain power and the resultant response from the Republican losers indicating , as they always have without result for ' change ' because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ' broken ' ( Which apparently he has been saying for the many years he has existed in the US senate without result -- why should he , he keeps getting elected saying the same things , if he changed something positively -- he may never again ) . What has happened to the Labor Party in Australia is also reflective . <p> In a sense the Western Democratic citizens themselves have been having a sort of revolution but , because as it appears to be in the Middle East and North Africa , have fallen back onto the same old political template because they have not been able to translate their desire for radical change into a workable solution -- and sure as hell the Political elites of Western Democracies as in North Africa and Middle East are not going to help them find it -- as in Egypt the Military is to retain power however hard it attempts to hide behind the thrown . Nothing changes particularly for women . <p> The fascinating thing is that the so called Arab Revolutions have reflected the attitudes of citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own regimes and a perception these so called democratic elites are in essence although not as draconian certainly self-serving -- and citizens are despairingly searching for an alternative ( but can only see their way clearly to severely punish each elite at each election turn -- the closest Western Democracies come to a revolution ) -- I suppose what is being called euphemistically an Arab way . <p> The trouble is we all concentrate on existing texts ethics religious and secular for informing our societal templates which frankly have not really delivered harmony and prosperity -- though they always claim they do , the evidence in terms of the inter sectarian strife and destructive self-interest inherent in such systems have failed humanity . In other words whatever the adherents of these texts may claim the textual construct translated into the nature of societies have delivered us what -- clearly there is something wrong with the foundation ethics -- I would say of all of them to date . <p> I suggest a third way an Arab way if you like . We need a new ethic to base our societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence nature and fellow humans provide . Our resources are restricted and our ability to achieve any level of independence is dependant on your neighbor and not just the one over the fence and vice versa . <p> This is the ethic -- It is only in seeking to maximize the relative independence of others first that we can maximize our own independence . <p> Means we are as much responsible for our neighbor 's welfare as our own without restriction . <p> Yes significant change -- but is it not required as the earths resources need to be divided between more and more people -- with the current political configuration and ethics this has meant and continues to mean what ? <p> There are two central aspects nature and fellow humanity both are critical to the nature of humanities survival and therefore inform the nature of the textual constructs which would frame relationships , laws , business , etc <p> Of course such a thing will not happen overnight as we continue to label what we do not understand with what we do , but I suggest for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the Fridge magnet on your reflective days : " Maximize the Relative Independence of Others First " <p> Means at least more washing up but as a solution for world problems starting at ones fridge and working outwards may be an answer humanities been looking for . <p> Text builds bridges , text also builds societies . Good foundations are the key to both . The foundation of Societies are ethics the above should help for better outcomes . <p> Hopefully they come up with an Arab way as long as it is not something relabeled as usual . <p> One thing that has not been factored in is that the oil producing countries in the Middle East are approaching or already have achieved their peak production rates . Soon , their production will decline . And then , they will no longer be able to bribe their citizens . Those countries will go down quickly as their citizens have grown to expect the bribes . <p> I believe the author does not have a good handle on geography and world history . In the case of Eastern Europe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external force . The Soviet Union was really not much different then lets say the Austrian Empire forceably holding peoples to the empire against their will . In the case of the Middle East , each country has their own despot . There is no home country to withdraw to . <p> In the case of Indonesia , there was a functioning merchant class be it an outsider people ( The Chinese ) . The merchant class that could have fullfilled this role in the middle east ( The Jews ) are long gone . In my opinion democracy will be very diffiicult to establish in the middle east because of the lack of mercentile flow in these countries . Even poor people of ambition want democracy as it improves the prospects of peace , stability , and prosperity . <p> If a collection of people have no stake in bettering their future internally , they really do not see a use for democracy . There is a very chance that the repressive despots will just be replaced by other despots be it secular or religious . I see a stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Russia Revolution was led by moderates but ultimately taken over by more disciplined and brutal tyrants who ultimately retained the boundries of the Russian Empire and later looked to expand it . I would like to be wrong . But I believe there are not enough people in these middle eastern countries who see a democracy as advantageous . Democracy requires negeotiation and compromise , something that there is little in the midde east . These are easier to do if you feel you have something to lose or if poor have something to gain . <p> Let me tell you this kind of COMRADERY ( transgressing even HOSTILE borders ) between Indian &; Pakistani Muslims , and American Muslims &; other Muslims ( who HATE America .... which is a vast majority in the Muslim world ! ) , is EXACTLY what has made Muslims largely UNTRUSTED here in America , as well as in India , Europe , Australia Russia , China , in short everywhere outside of the Muslim world ! . <p> Given that such attitudes are only hardening all over the world , surely we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even though for political correctness American &; western leaders may not admit that , what is essentially going on as " War on Terror " in Afghanistan , Iraq , Pakistan , the middle east as well as even inside our free nations is an " unstated " ideological war between progressive/tolerant forces and the others . We are manifestations of this even all over normally tolerant America , Europe where there is huge opposition against mosques , Muslim communities nearly everywhere . <p> All these " cataclysmic " events are taking place inspite of President Obama 's well known Muslim bias , only b'coz of the deep rooted belief &; fear in Americans not to let these forces take over their country or dramatically alter its tolerant , Christian ethos . That applies to India as well , given that even Hindu politicians frequently pander to Muslims for votes , the vast majority of re-awakened Hindus ( more so the highly educated ones ) are determined not to let their country be taken over by these cancerous ideologies ! <p> So , in conclusion while we Hindus ( &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in India ) and likewise in America ( all non-Muslims Vs.Muslims ) do indeed outwardly mix with each other , deep down , we all are aware of the inherent divisions and contradictions in our " **25;6845;TOOLONG " which do manifest itself from time to time in the form of workplace/neighborhood discriminations , even as we PRETEND otherwise ! In fact all such differences come to the fore around lunch tables , parties and other events ONLY after making sure no one from the other group is around ! I am not sure if these attitudes will change unless there is a groundswell of introspection within the communities to ensure that they can live in true harmony in today 's multi-polar , multi-racial , multi-religious world ............... most people do n't see that happening at least with regard to one community which is sinking father away in to the abyss ! ! ! <p> People like Mr. FAREED ZAKARIA are only adding to that mess , wish he takes a cue from some of the most enlightened , pragmatic souls in his own Muslim community ( Indians , Pakistanis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Husain , Nadeem Paracha , I A Rehman , Meher Ali , Kamraan Shafi , A R Rehman , Walid Shoebat , Zuhdi Jasser , Abdul Kalaam , Azim Premji , Aamir Khan , Asra Nomani , Taslima Nazreen , Dr.Pervez Hoodbhoy , Ayaan Hirsi Ali , Wafa Sultan and several others . <p> Lastly , why am I hard on my own former countryman Mr.Zakaria ? That 's b'coz he 's intelligent , smart , highly educated and is undoubtedly hugely influential amongst both Muslims and even more importantly non-Muslims in America &; India , a lot of whom are now realizing his hidden Muslim agenda . Once that comes completely out in the fore , I doubt if any American or Indian will support any Muslim intellectual as a voice of moderation ! <p> Mr. F.Zakaria 's opinion and expertise on the Islamic world and the Middle East should be taken with a grain of salt . Before and after the Bush invasion of Iraq Mr. Zakaria in his Time magazine articles he was touting the Bernard Lewis and the neo-con line that the overthrow of Saddam 's regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Democratic regimes in the Middle East will replace autocratic rule . What a delusion ? Iraq after Saddam has become a state where Iran 's mullahs call the shots in Baghdad and the country after the departure of the US troops will slip into anarchy . This man does not recognize the influence that Islam has in the life of the average person in the Middle East street and the effects and the reaction to modernity the Arab-Isreali conflict casts in the events on that part of the world . <p> " This man does not recognize the influence that Islam has in the life of the average person in the Middle East street and the effects and the reaction to modernity the Arab-Isreali conflict casts in the events on that part of the world . " <p> Here 's one more response I posted at the following link , which I strongly believe is very relevant to this discussion : <p> Ron M : <p> I absolutely agree with you . <p> I wonder why we are continuing to spill American blood in that wasteland , and burning billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Unless our interests are really impacted we need not worry , least of all Muslim countries b'coz either way it 's going to come back to haunt America ! <p> Let 's leave it to the Organization of Islamic countries ( OIC ) to handle it , if they want to ! After-all , they have 1.5 billion people , and TRILLIONS IN CASH that we have given them in return for their oil ( which we have NOT stolen from them ! ! <p> Further , we also should take care not to allow people who do not adapt , and harbor nothing but hatred for America , and overtly &; covertly sympathize with our detractors , to immigrate into this country . Of the people already here , there must be a lot more surveillance on their religious and other places to really keep a tab on what they are upto . As a Hindu American I welcome security agencies to monitor our temples ( even covertly ) . <p> As a no-Christian , non-white recent immigrant I say , let us implement some COVERT racial profiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep an extra eye on people who look like me and spare the innocent whites . I say this b'coz I am NOT willing to sacrifice my life in the garb of political correctness by letting someone who looks like me to get on my plane with ulterior motives . <p> Quite frankly , free nations like America , Europe and India are digging their own graves by bending over backwards in accommodating these ungrateful people . THAT MUST CHANGE ! <p> Plz. check out my other responses here ( if you can spare some time ! ) &; let me know if you agree with me . You will need an hour at least to read through them all ! <p> Amit-Atlanta-USA <p> April 25 , 2011 at 11:50 am Reply <p> Here 's the link to the above : http : **35;6872;TOOLONG ... <p> Zakaria is an irritating short statured a hole that loves to comment on being paid for his comments and is using the freedom of speech in this country to malign those who he does n't agree with . All for a PRICE . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor in their socio economical societies , nothing is going to change . Muslims should consider converting to Christianity , preferably to any Middle Eastern Christian Church which shares the same language and culture as Muslims except their distorted Islamic ethical and moral standards . <p> 10 , 20 or 30 years , it does nt matter . We can plan or predict whatever we desire .. Seems like Fareed 's been drinking too much of the fake Democracy kool aid . The Fact is democracy as we know it , is at best less than 100 years old and has no right to claim to be the best for mankind . I mean dictatorships , kingdoms and anarchy 's have more right to claim success with 10 's of 100 's of years of rule to proove . Fact is that the abrahamic religion in it 's purest form will rule again and will rise again with a system thats planned by the greatest of the planners and supported by the most powerful . Allah , yes Allah , the same Allah ( god ) that was behind Adam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jews and Muslims will be rewarded . Rule will be just and will be the best of times .... but before we get there , there will be these 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 ...... or simply N number of years with what we know of " today like " ... so relax ...... and save your energy .. <p> That 's a great sentiment , but I do n't want to lose my head to find out . That 's the problem , people preach the kinder gentler aspects of the religion of Islam while what 's on the ground and proven is completely different . 10 , 20 , 100 , yrs will not change the way people think or observe their god , whether it 's allah of the east or God of the west . Your predictions are as suspect and full of prostelyzing as mr . Zakaria 's are full of false predictions and false hope . <p> Fareed Zakaria 's knowledge of the subject is deeply primitve and his analysis is stupid and contradicts to the facts on the ground . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and war . <p> Yep exactly , all these revolutions are good for muslims and islam . Infact , the fake democracy is a good way to break up these dictatorships in the middleast . U.S and the west have relied on these dictatorships which actually helped the u.S/israel agenda . But now that the U.S is promoting change thinking the democratic govts will U.S even further , well think twice . ONce again , good for muslims/islam in the long run because it will pave the way for a united Islamic nation run under sharia law ( the most fair constitution around ) written by the most supreme ( Allah , yes Allah the same god true Christians and Jews worshipped before they fell prey to pagans ) . Good luck ! ... <p> Guys , I suppose you all know that unless the Koran is rewritten to accommodate latest changes in human right , freedom of speech , freedom of religion , gender equality , social justice nothing is going to be changed in ME . So , not point to get engaged in unproductive discussions . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was like in the past ... tribal bandits chopping each other 's heads off in the desert over a stolen camel , some perceived insult about their sister 's hummus recipe , or the fact that the guilty party 's great-great-grandfather prayed only four times a day instead of five . Yes , I know what you 're all thinking , so let 's get it out of the way now . <p> RACIST ! ! ! BIGOT ! ! ! HATE-MONGER ! ! ! TROLL ! ! ! <p> Feel better ? Good , let 's move on , shall we ? <p> The simple fact is that most Middle Eastern governments are propped up by authoritarianism . These dictators that are currently being overthrown will only be replaced by new ones . With a few exceptions , Arab and Muslim countries do n't really do well with democracy . We in the Western world like to think they would if given the chance , but people power in the Middle East usually translates into chaos and bloodshed . Consider what Iraq and Afghanistan were like after we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from havens of democracy before , but at least the strongmen in power kept the population in check . These people do n't understand the concept of freedom and democracy , and the few that do have emigrated to other countries . This is n't prejudicial bigotry here , people , it 's simple truth . This region of the world has a history far older than our own , and at no point has that history been a democratic one . You ca n't undo thousands of years of social conditioning just because the West has embraced democracy in a fraction of that time . Once the oil wells run dry , global warming turns what little farmland they have left into dust bowls , and the old dictatorships get a little too stale , violent revolution will perpetuate the cycle until there is nothing left but a few waring tribes -- just like when they started . At that point , at the very least , they will have the benefit of hindsight to guide their path to the future . <p> That is a very dark and fundamentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously have no idea nor any desire to know the truth of very nuanced cultures which have been repressed but actually are comprised of very intelligent and well educated people . <p> I always laugh ( or cry ) when I hear these so-called " experts " predicting the future . 10 years down the line ? ? ? Fareed Zakaria in his wildest dreams could not have predicted the fall in Egypt and Tunisia , the turmoil in Libya and Syria " 1 " month before it happened . And he is going to predict 10 yrs down the line . Give me a break ! <p> LIKEWISE . Mr. ZAKARIA 's TAQIYYA may actually help him win some support for the Muslim community in general amongst GULLIBLE Americans , but in the longer term people will see though his COVERT ISLAMIST AGENDA with FAR REACHING CONSEQUENCES for the community ..... which is already well underway ! <p> Fareed . It 's 4 quarters for a dollar . Whoever will take power from the current tyrants in all these arab countries will eventually become corrupt themselves . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The founders of America were highly intelligent business people and inventors that saw that freedom was the pillar to peace and prosperity . When arab mothers implore their children to go to school instead of throwing rocks at soldiers on the street , the flame of true democracy and freedom will soon begin . Otherwise it 's same sh*t different day . <p> Zakaria has been realistic in analyzing the world events . Israel is a democracy therefore the chances of upheaval are almost zero People are not oppressed as in a dictatorship and if at all there is any issue then that is dealt in a democratic manner not by overthrowing the regime as is the case with the arab world . Besides , Islam is the religion of the arab world and that will play an important role in unifying them during the crisis period . <p> the fact that Zakaria does n't mention israel is because it is a moot issue . Some of the changes happening in these countries are driven by secular progressive movements and while they might have severe antagonism against Israelis , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something along these lines that the people of these nations hate Israel as much as they hate each other along religious lines and this is very true . i worked in Oman and been to the UAE , Egypt , Qatar and SA for over 10 years and even there this was shockingly evident . unless they radically address these problems , they are going no where . So i differ with Zakarai and 10 years from now , the status qou will still remain the same . <p> My question is , this article assumes the US to be a constant player in the events that unfold . What if the US does not get control of its economy and China , or some other nation becomes the big player in world events ? What happens if the US ceases to be a player in world events as all , because of its economic problems ? <p> On the positive side , what happens if the US and the developed nations find a way to replace oil ? how does this change the article above ? <p> No peace expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gas Pipeline between Egypt and Israel , and ongoing rapprochement between Egypt and Iran , my simple conclusion is that Jan25 Tahrir protests aimed at aligning Egypt with Iran objectives and extremism . This process started by destroying Mubarak moderate regime , tarnishing image with no evidence . Another strong indicator of shifting to extremism is that one-sided democracy in Egypt , no media reports on Mubarak supporters demos at Maspero TV building area , biggest last Friday , and upcoming one on April 29 tomorrow . <p> No mention of Israel in the article . The State of Israel is the number ONE country to watch as I believe that nation will play a key roll in the Middle Easth . It is amazing to me that the article did not even mention Israel , like that nation is not part of the Middle East picture . Anyway , God will protect Israel from those terror organizations who would try to do her harm ! <p> I completely agree with you Jim . And for those of you that hate me saying this because you know it 's true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are happening currently in the middle east has been prophesied in the Bible . So if the Bible states that there will be turmoil in the middle east then do n't you think that it could be right about other things , such as the comming of Christ . Me personally I 'm anxiously waiting that day , because I know that the turmoil in the Middle East is never going to end , because there has been at least something going on for almost twenty years , so I think in ten more years there is n't going to be a change at all . Unless we as a country stop getting ourselves into anymore trouble within other countries and learn how to face our economic problem first . The Middle East has so many different forms of government , and that 's their biggest problem . Nobody can go in there and fix the problem with THEIR government because WE are not part of any of THEIR countries . Therefore I believe we stay out , withdraw our troops from Iraq fix our own economical problems first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . In order to help someone out you need to help yourself first . If you 're not stable and you help someone else they 're not going to be stable either . IT 'S COMMON SENSE ! <p> Thank God for Fareed . I am just saying that , because it sound better that " Thank God for Zakaria " . The social social cyle move forward in evolutionary and revolutionary ways . No place is the same . PROUT ( Progressive Utilization Theory ) - now that 's the enlightened path ! <p> Here 's what I wrote on Fareed Zakarias appeal to readers to discuss why Israeli-Peace is NOT round the corner . <p> Specifically by saying " Why Israel-Palestinian peace is NOT imminent " Mr. Zakaria is HERDING the flock ( gullible readers ! ) into thinking ONLY along his line of NOT wanting to talk peace , rather than giving an opportunity for readers to vet their views from both sides ! ! ! ! ! <p> Here 's what I wrote &; the link : http : **35;6909;TOOLONG ... <p> Looks like things seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAMAS sign peace deal which means that going forward Israel will have to negotiate with a terrorist entity committed to the destruction of Israel &; its main proponent America ! b ) Today we hear that Egypt has unilaterally &; permanently opened its Rafah checkpost , the only border crossing into Gaza outside of Israeli territory . Clearly a breach of the 2005 international agreement to curb the smuggling of arms/rockets into Gaza . c ) Islamist supporters like Mr. Zakaria blatantly saying that the Israel-Egyptian peace accord was between two regimes ( &; NOT its peoples ) , covertly implying that Egypt while keeping the Sinai can abrogate the deal . d ) President Obama 's known soft corner for the " so-called " Palestinian struggle to the detriment of the safety &; security our only true ally in the ME -- Israel . Looks like everything is falling in place for a unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood b4 the end of the year ! ! But , thanks to overwhelming support for Israel among the America people , and the widespread distrust of the Muslim agenda in America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speech , support for the GZ Victory Mosque , vow to close Gitmo &; trail of hard core Islamic radicals in civilian courts etc. , on many of which he had to humbly retreat ! <p> Hopefully American public pressure will also stop Obama him from doing anything remotely encouraging the Palestinians from unilaterally &; stupidly declaring statehood ! <p> Mr. Zakaria 's deep rooted " hatredness " for Israel , dislike of America , Europe , Russia , and in short the entire free world whom he " perceives " to have ganged up against Muslims everywhere , is " just too apparent " , even as he " pretends " to love America ! Mr. Zakria 's love for America is limited to the opportunities he has had in realizing his dreams , making money , enjoying religious freedoms , overall fairness &; magnanimity of Americans , and his ability to influence &; be heard by a lot of ( gullible ? ) Americans , while being perched on top of respected media agencies . <p> So Mr. Zakaria being highly educated is neither nave nor stupid as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zakaria should also not be confused for other liberals who espouse true equality/freedoms for all Americans without encouraging mis-use of those very same freedoms with utter lack of sensitivity to other Americans . <p> Those are the " precise " reasons ( in addition to Hollywood blockbusters ) , a lot of urban educated Muslims all over the world " swear " they love America ( or is it grudgingly envy America ? ) . On the contrary they are firmly rooted in the " Islamic Radical camp " when it comes to nursing the " never ending list " of " worldwide " Muslim grievances which Mr.Zakaria himself links " all the time ' to explain away dissatisfaction of American Muslims ! <p> The " only CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE " between such " so-called Muslim MODERATES and their JIHADIST brothers/sisters is in that , they do n't support burning of girls ' schools , trashing their women , forcing their women to wear the Burqa , or imposition of Sharia rule ( ONLY for business , as it deprives them of any business transaction that generates profits , which is unacceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few other such reasons . <p> Short of these , there is absolutely NO DIFFERENCE between Muslim RADICALS ' &; " Muslim MODERATES ' line of thinking on the " Supremacy of Islam " , " Monotheism " , " Injustices " by the west ( both real &; perceived ) , adherence to the " Muslim Ummah " . It 's such TRANS-NATIONAL allegiance to their religion and NOT to their homelands that makes a lot of Americans ( Europeans , Indians , Israelis , Russians .... ) rightfully question their " Patriotism " and " trustworthiness " when it comes to national security issues . <p> Check out this video from Mr. Imran Khan one of Pakistan 's leading , politicians with a huge support base among the educated , urban , and " so-called Moderate Pakistanis " . A careful review of his message shows that Mr. Khan ( and his Pakistani elite ) inspite of being modern in his outlook , articulate , western educated , formerly married to a Christian British women etc. is " in reality " no more different from the Islamic radicals he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Having said that I have written extensively in these columns stating my reasons for believing in what many Americans already know of Mr. Zakaria . <p> Particularly on the Israeli-Palestinian issue Mr. Zakaria routinely trashes Israel for oppression against the " so-called " Palestinians while " Never ever " referring to HAMAS ' single point agenda of " destroying Israel " and also its main proponent America ! <p> While there are " far too many " articles by Mr. Zakaria trashing Israel , and America , the following from his CNN-Fareed Zakaria-GPS lays bare " his no-holds barred " approach in supporting Muslim issues in the ME , and his " Crusade " to get Muslim Turkey into the European Union ( EU ) thereby opening the floodgates for mass Muslim migration into Europe &; America ( in the garb of building bridges between the west &; Islam ) . http : **35;6946;TOOLONG ... <p> Do n't forget ... The current Government of Iran is the result of a popular uprising against the secular/ authoritarian Government lead by the Shah of Iran . <p> Libya , Syria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt can look in the mirror of Iran and see what it will become . <p> After the " " armed " " Muslim Brotherhood , Hezbollah , Hamas etc. quiets the " " unarmed " " voices of democracy through intimidation and murder all the above states will become radicalized Islamic theocracies . <p> Calls to abrogate the peace treaty with Israel have already been announced by the Muslim Brotherhood . That is not a goal of a peaceful democratic movement . <p> There is some much to be positive about I did n't want to make a remark because my opinion differs greatly . I do not hold the same faith that many of you share . I believe radical Muslim faith will eventually win out in many if not all of these countries involved in " Arab Spring . " Terrible events will follow as the crowds become frenzied and atrocity after atrocity will occur due to radical Muslims perverting the Islam Religion . Israel will be in imminent danger and eventually will be involved in a nuclear catastrophe attributed to , not good Muslims , but radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be up in arms on how to react ( retaliate ) . The fall of the kings and dictators will end up being the beginning of a new age -- Radical Muslim taking over key political/religious positions and inciting their populations towards hate . Curse me , tell me I 'm wrong till you 're red in the face because I truly hope this wo n't be the case but nothing has convinced me so far -- certainly not words from the political analysts of the world . <p> The real " gorilla " in the equation is the hate that will not disapate against America no matter how much fundamental change happens there . Our history with them is based on one thing , Israel . As long as we support them as we should , there will be issues . We could pull every ounce of military , and aid , and completely retire from the region , but would continue to face their scorn due to our right support of Israel . <p> Those issues did n't matter 40 or 50yrs. ago when we could squash them like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , they do not fear that as they should not to be truly free people , but their idea of freedom may be radically different than ours . <p> We need to continue to support Israel , a tough little country that stll knows a bit of curb due to US influence . The present administration will pass and in 10 yrs . perhaps another couple of administrations will come and go , while the Arab world sticks with one group or person for decades . Israel left to it 's own devices stil holds one card that they fear , the Sampson Option , which as we all know is their deterrent . With out US curb , they might feel cornered and use it some day . <p> Already the Isreali ministers are bantering around a strike on Irans facilities again , why ? , They know the present administration will do nothing to counter any pressure on them and they frankly appear to no longer trust the US , at least the present administration . <p> 10 yrs is too short of a time to expunge a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not abandon for any reason . 100 yrs would be too short . <p> To predict the future we must must first set up scenarios . The Egyption scenario : slow progression towards democracy . The stumbling block is Syria . The Syrian scenario will continue as it is today at least for the next five years assuming the religious leader will live for another five years . Several scenarios for Egypt , Israel , Jordan . If a feasible scenario evolves here it will stabilize the Middle East , though continual disussion will be required over the next ten years to counteract mental drift ( the tendency of people to forget their promises and obligations ) . <p> In ten years , if the world is lucky , alternative fuels will collapse the demand for oil . In the Middle East , Jihad will lose its police-state sponsors , and the OPEC nations will become a quiet backwater of madness and cannibalism . The the West , apologists for these regimes will live comfortably in group housing and enjoy the benefits of antipsychotic medication . <p> It is absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Israel is the 800 pound gorilla , not Saudi Arabia . If Israel , and its U.S. sugar daddy , persist with their present policies of territorial annexation , economic exploitation , and other forms of interference in Arab societies , then the future for the mid-east , and Israel , is not bright . If Israel amends its ways , withdraws from occupied territories , and makes substantive attempts to settle outstanding issues with the Palestinians , Syria and Lebanon , then perhaps , there will light at the end of the tunnel . <p> The on going war in the middle east between the so called Jews and their neighbours is only a distraction from the truth . WHAT WOULD IT TELL US ABOUT THE BIBLE AND ITS CONTENT IF THE JEWS WERE REMOVED FROM ISREAL TODAY . THE TRUTH WHICH HAVE BEEN HIDDEN FROM US . <p> In terms of the political vacuum that has been left in Egypt , I might agree that there are definitely strong parallels that could lead to consideration for Egypt following a like path of Indonesia in post colonial development . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post regime independance ; how Indonesia seperated from Dutch rule as an entirely different cultrure having been greatly influenced by its colonizers , and , a post Mubarak Egypt where social cast witin the same culture dictated the course of revolution . <p> Indonesia had re-established itself as its own new nation after dutch rule . And the institutions at the time , much as with India and British rule , did not entirely seperate with their former ' oppressors ' . Indeed , it was Dutch influence that permanetly augmented any direction the country would have taken on its . Better to think of the post colonial relationship as an amicable divorce after a brief and only somewhat hostile seperation with terms of alimony and visitation rights . Jakarta has always maintianed economic ties with the west , including Holland . <p> Egypt , on the other hand , has just shed itself of its own poison ; corruption from within that by that time was less than a legacy of former colonial influence . And further , the fact that the ruling elite profited through direct relations with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transitions well on the mantle of ideological reforms rather than national independance . Egypt has just overthrown their Tsar . <p> While Indonesia has , relatively speaking , taken the more lethargic road into the proceding eras , Egypt , I believe , will continue to be a growing hotbed of revolutionary zeal , especially when we consider the comparatively more dynamic organization of an oppressed cast that initiated change wholey on their own . I see the country either lining itself up to oust another future despot , or spending several generations resolving its own identity within the region , if not the world . It will not be calm . <p> You sound much better when you talk about your own world.This is your call . Look at your own either belly button or tale , and forget about someone else 's problems , considering you do n't own enough knowledge about them . I am talking about your comments on Brazil Economy , and on calling Corinthians an " small soccer team " in the " small

##556450 <h> Do You Have a Speeding Ticket ? Read This . <p> It 's a classic scenario : you 're cruising along at ten miles over the speed limit in an attempt to keep up with the rest of the cars on the road . You think you are simply going with the flow of traffic , when you suddenly see flashing lights in your rear view mirror . In an instant , you find yourself holding a $325 speeding ticket . <p> The headache of dealing with a traffic ticket does n't necessarily go away when you pay the fine . When points go on your driving record and your insurance company finds out , you could be hit with insurance surcharges of up to 30% for the next three years . <p> That 's why whether you 're guilty of an infraction or not , attorneys and legal experts say you should first investigate all legal options before you jump to pay that ticket . With a little homework and effort , you may be able to pay a reduced fine and avoid having it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake <p> In many municipalities , traffic tickets are a big source of county revenues . John Bowman , Communications Director for the National Motorists Association , says fines collected from traffic tickets amount to billions of dollars . The association recommends that drivers always fight their tickets and it even publishes a 250-page guide on how to do it . <p> Bowman says whether you 're guilty or not , you should use every legal measure available to try to minimize your fine and , most importantly , try to prevent it from impacting your insurance premiums . <p> " Depending on the infraction and your driving record , it can cause your insurance premiums to rise by up to 30% for the next three years . The fine is just the beginning , " says Bowman . <p> Barry Kowitt of Unger and Kowitt Law Firm in Miami said that from start to finish , a simple traffic ticket could easily be " more than a $1,000 experience . " That includes the fine , court costs , and increased insurance premiums . For most drivers , that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he 's seen clients who have had to make the decision between paying the ticket and paying their rent . <p> " And that could be simply because you were doing ten miles over the speed limit to keep up with traffic . It is in your interest to fight it because your options are not that great , " says Kowitt . <p> Yet Bowman says perhaps only 5% of drivers actually contest their tickets . Because drivers may feel so hopeless in fighting the system or because they may think the $200 fine is the end of it , most simply pay the fine and then move on . <h> Explore your options before paying <p> When you immediately pay a ticket , you 're automatically admitting guilt and will voluntarily pay the highest fine . You 'll often have up to 90 days to enter a plea or pay the fine , so take some time to explore your options . <p> " Fighting " a ticket usually does n't mean going to court in front of a judge and district attorney . Bowman says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . " <p> If it 's your first ticket in the jurisdiction , you should ask the clerk if there is a special " no contest " plea for first-time offenders . In many cases , the district attorney will offer first-time offenders a reduced fine and will not release the citation to the insurance company . <p> If that 's not an option , start examining every piece of information on the ticket . This includes confirming all of your information , as well as the notes and documentation provided by the ticketing officer . <p> Ask yourself the following questions : Is the citation number correct ? Is the intersection and location correct ? What about the time of day ? You can file a " discovery of motion " to request all the information about your case , including the officer 's notes , calibration certificates for the radar gun , and other details , which will help you in your investigation . <p> Kowitt says missing or incorrect information on a citation can often be grounds for dismissal . <p> " We see cases in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have incorrect information . In many cases , a little bit of homework can go a long way , " says Kowitt . <h> Minimizing fines and insurance impacts <p> " If you do have to make a court appearance , another option is to try to reschedule it to increase the odds that the ticketing officer does n't show , " says Alex Carroll , author of Beat the Cops . Because you have the legal right to question your accuser , a case will often be dismissed if a cop is a no-show . <p> You might also be able to approach the District Attorney and simply ask for a plea to a lesser infraction . " Most traffic courts are going to offer some level of flexibility , " says Scott Feifer , an attorney with Feifer and Greenberg in New York . <p> Feifer says while New York City does n't offer plea bargaining , most other counties around the country do . There can be a lot of overhead in taking a case to trial , which is why many courts allow you to simply pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the court the impression that you are serious about fighting the ticket , you are going to have a lot more leverage and control over the process , " says Bowman . <p> Because traffic courts might have to handle hundreds of cases per day , there just is n't enough funding , staffing , and time to take every single one to trial . Merely showing up to the courthouse can make a big difference because no one wants you to clog the system . <p> If you received the speeding ticket in another town , another option might be to fight the ticket by mail -- usually called a " trial by declaration . " Carroll says a reasonable and coherent argument can often result in a dismissal , because police officers are required to submit written rebuttals , which does n't always happen . <p> " You can never go wrong contesting a ticket if you have the time and energy , because you 're almost always going to come out ahead , " says Bowman . <p> Craig Guillot is a business and personal finance writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate , retirement and debt .

##576951 <h> Work out smarter , not harder ... <p> About a year ago my husband and I started working out as we wanted to get back into shape and get abs , since moving to San Diego -- we 'd really wanted to be able to go to the beach without being embarrassed . We started going to the gym daily , and doing massive amounts of situps and crunches to get flat abs , and tone up our enlarged mid-sections ( or flab tabs , as we call em lol ) . Neither of us knew how to really train our bodies properly , so we did what we thought everyone did to get six pack abs -- and that of course is to work that stomach area every day . <p> We even hired a personal trainer -- which was expensive , and really did n't help us that much at all ... Lame . <p> After nearly 6 months of working out nearly everyday , we could run faster and father . We could lift a little more on the bench press , but neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting to be a battle to go to the gym , and I knew there had to be away to conquer the bulge hanging over my belt . I had worked so hard to get nice abs in time for summer , but by June , ( which I had set as my goal ) I still felt embarrassed to be seen in my bikini . <p> My husband and I continued going to the gym all the time , sometimes even working out with our personal trainer still ... We kept up a simple workout routine ; warm up , run a mile , 100 sit ups , 3 sets of 10-15 reps on weights , then stretch . One day , while I was warming up , I could n't help but hear these two girls talking -- you know the ones -- the girls who seem to do NOTHING but are sexier than EVERYONE ELSE AT THE GYM ? ? ? LoL ... <p> These girls obviously knew how to get ripped abs , they had lean waistlines but they were n't skinny , they were buff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those ab curl machines struggling to do sit ups . One girl said , " I think its so funny when people think you get abs by doing a million situps . " <p> They laughed . I cringed . <p> " I never to situps . Do you ? " -- and her friend responded with something like , " I did before I knew better . I hav n't done a situp or crunch in FOREVER ! " <p> Then they started talking about some other stupid crap , so I walked away -- wondering what the hell everyone else ( myself included ) was doing wrong .. Why was I slaving away to get toned abs , and these girls did n't even try , and they had the body I wanted so badly ? It was BS . <p> I went home to do some research about how to get abs , and I found this site that I 'll share with you in a minute .. <p> This site is LOADED with info that echoed exactly what those prissy , annoying , stuck-up girls at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with fresh vigor -- using the nutrition and excercise techniques that you 're about to learn -- and within a month , I had dropped so significantly in pants size , that my husband gladly bought me all new jeans to fit my ' new shape ' . This was all without doing one painful crunch or annoying situp ... ... Thank GOD . <p> I wo n't lie . These methods are n't as easy as eating chocolate cake and watching Psych or Breaking Bad on Netflix all day ... But it 's as close to ' easy ' as six pack abs get . <p> I highly recommend that you go check out this site for the best way to get ripped abs , and get that belly ready for the bikini -- or like my husband -- get it ready for your size 32 surf shorts . <p> Sexy . Let me tell you . haha . <p> When I finally had the confidence to take off my shirt , and expose my tummy I was actually on a nature hike at Torrey Pines State Park . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , mine got the most comments from friends and family over how amazing and buff my abs looked . I was so thankful that I found a way to get the toned abs and get what I 'd always wanted . Now you can too , by simply clicking the button below . <p> PS : Best of luck ! I 'm glad I could share this secret with you ! I wish someone 
##581951 <p> However , the freshman running back did n't predict the spectacular manner he 'd score his first TD for Arkansas . Or that he 'd score a second equally exciting one in a 49-7 severe-weather shortened Razorbacks ' win against Kentucky . <p> After the Arkansas defense forced a three-and-out on Kentucky 's first possession , the Razorbacks got the ball at their own 26 . Quarterback Tyler Wilson dropped back and looked left . Williams was running down the sideline and the Wildcat covering him slipped on the rain-slickened Razorback Stadium turf . <p> Wilson hit Williams in stride , who then slipped through the grasp of two more Wildcats as he cut back across the field . He sprinted to the right corner of the end zone and dove in for his first career TD on his first career reception . <p> Wilson said the play was almost an exact replica of one from earlier in the week . <p> " It was big , first play of the game , it was exactly how we drew it up , " Wilson said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a move similar to the one he did -- cutting back across the field and scoring a touchdown . " <p> Wilson said he knew Williams was his main target as soon as they reached the line of scrimmage . <p> " I knew he was one-on-one versus a defensive end in that look . I like my odds on a wheel route ( in that situation ) , " Wilson said . " We knew we had to get him involved ... to help us , because he can do a lot after the catch . " <p> Williams ended the first quarter just as he started it . <p> After Arkansas got the ball back with four seconds left in the quarter , Williams ran the same wheel route down the sideline . Again Wilson hit him perfectly in stride and Williams did the rest for a 77-yard touchdown . <p> With the catches , Williams became the first UA freshman with two touchdowns of 74-yards or more in one game . The only longer touchdowns for Arkansas this season was an 80-yard Wilson to Cobi Hamilton pass in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head coach John L. Smith said Williams ' big first quarter is the tip of the iceberg for what the freshman from Allen , Texas , can do . <p> " He 's a tremendous football player . We like using him a lot ... he can run down the field and catch the football , " Smith said . " Plus he 's a real good running back . He 's got tremendous vision . He 's got things you ca n't teach and one of those things is great vision . He 'll go here , drift there and you 'll go ' Well , how did you see that ? ' and he 'll say ' I do n't know , I just did . ' He 's like that . He 'll continue to get better . " <p> Williams finished the quarter -- and game -- with three catches for 150 yards and two TDs . Not a bad effort for a player who had not caught a pass coming into the Kentucky game . Williams

##595751 <p> " We get back to work , get out to practice today , clean up the little things . As you look back and see all the small things , how they are , and I mean so many little small things . We were first-and-goal on the three-yard line ; and we score a touchdown with a minute to go we 're on-side kicking down six . Come up with the ball and you 're looking at a score to win the game . " <p> " Instead it comes out to be I guess what is like a blowout loss . That 's how small the margin of error is in this league . So it 's critical for us , and I think our guys understand that 's how small that margin of error is ; the detail that we need . Because there are a lot of things in that game , little things if we corrected we would have put ourselves in an opportunity to win it . We did n't . And guys can really get back to work and focusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find a way to win the game this week , in every phase of the game . " <p> " So as a staff we 've got to make sure we 're cleaner , our players have to cleaner . And it 's a big game . It 's a last home game for our seniors . This is my first recruiting class . I think they 're leaving one of the most successful classes in school history . And their last opportunity in front of the fans ; and the fans their last opportunity to come thank them and show their support to what these guys have meant to the program . And how they finish off their career the right way here at home . " <p> Chad Bumphis is having a career season , how much has he grown and what is his legacy ? " I mean he 's grown an awful lot . He came in with a lot of expectations on him and he 's lived up to a lot of those expectations . His legacy , I think he holds at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the top receivers in school history . So I think he 's going to leave a pretty good legacy on what he did during his career here . " <p> How important was signing Bumphis to making a mark and keeping him in-state ? " It was huge . It certainly helped me because he was the only guy in that recruiting class that I knew before I got here . That I had a relationship with before I got here . So think it was huge because he ended up helping be kind of a bridge to the other guys , all those guys that decided to stick together and play for their state school and represent the state of Mississippi . He 's that bridge of telling guys hey , I 've known Coach a little bit longer than everybody else , I think we can do some pretty good things here . " <p> Now do you break down some of the struggles establishing the running game ? " Get a big early lead and we 'll run the ball a lot more ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , because you look throughout course of the game ; you look at the last game and there are opportunities . When you fall behind ... and we were moving the ball and we needed to move the ball continually . I think that score before half kind of forced our hand into throwing more a little bit more instead of staying a little more balanced . And every time we tried to get it back to balance we fell behind again . So it forced us to throw the ball a little bit more . " " But I do n't think we were n't running the ball ; I do n't think we had the opportunity to continue to stick with that , by making those mistakes and falling behind . " <p> When you got here and recruited John Banks , is it a story that it 's hard to find East Webster High School ? " I do n't know , but that 's what they told me . Because I looked at our roster , and one of the first things I did was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys ? We got to John Banks and they said he 's at East Webster High School , there 's not like a lot of traffic going through East Webster High School to recruit him , he 's pretty solidly committed . " <p> " We drive out there to East Webster High School . I 've seen us with some GPSs with some of my new coaches and we end up in the middle of the field when you type in an address . GPS does n't always hold true in Mississippi ! With John , it was one of those they said nobody 's really ever even been through to come look on him once he committed to Mississippi State . I think we were his only scholarship offer , I think he had junior colleges looking at him but we were his only scholarship offer . It held true . " <p> When recruiting Banks was he the kind of player you watch the tape and saw wow ? " Well , no . You pop the tape in and say , OK , what is he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on the field . And a lot of things , one of the hardest things is when you 're looking at small-school guys is you 're evaluating that player 's talent . A lot of players you can look at the talent around him and say , OK , well look , he 's running away from all these guys , and he 's running away from a guy that 's committed to Auburn . So OK , he 's pretty fast . There were n't many guys John was playing that were going on to play college football , so you 're kind of evaluating him on his own abilities really with nobody to judge around him on where he is . When we saw him , we thought he 'd be something . We did n't know if he 'd be a DB or a receiver or what he would grow into when we signed him , but we knew he was a good football player . " <p> Is Nick Griffin getting his confidence back after the start last week ? " He came in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to go start on the road at LSU for your first start is probably a pretty big deal . Really not even finding out officially until I 'd say an hour before kickoff . I think he handled that very , very well , and he played hard . He did some good things . He graded a champion in the game and did his job . That was a real positive and something that will be a real positive to build on in the future . " <p> What have you seen from Corey Broomfield coaching him ? " Corey 's a guy that 's believed in our program right from when we got here , has done a good job , takes care of his business in the classroom , takes care of his business on the field , maximizes his potential . He 's not the biggest guy , he 's not the fastest guy or the strongest guy , but he plays very smart and he maximizes his potential out there on the field . " <p> After playing almost three full games is Tobias Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffett schedule : Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays . He 'll rest today , practice tomorrow , rest Wednesday , practice Thursday , rest Friday , play Saturday . That 's it . Injury department , we 've got guys that are banged up . The only one that is questionable this week is Ferlando Bohanna with a groin strain . With anything that 's muscular , he 's day to day . So we 've got to see how that holds true , how that comes out . We expect LaDarius Perkins to play , but again it 's a muscular thing , so the trainers expect him to be good to go to play and be out on the practice field by Wednesday . With those things , there 's not an exact calendar on it . " <p> Were there different defensive things you did in the secondary against LSU ? " What we tried to do in matchups is having the ability to move John Banks around is really what it was . I think a lot of teams were trying to just stay away from John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then just go completely away from that . So we tried to move , like let Corey play some corner in nickel situations and have the ability to move John Banks around some . To do that , you put Jay Hughes on the field . I thought Jay played pretty well during the course of the game . It was more of those flexibility things that we wanted to maybe put John in position to make more plays . " <p> Will you continue this and did it work out ? " To me , the breakdowns were n't a result of that stuff . The breakdowns , we had a guy get a wrong signal and blitz when he was n't supposed to blitz , and we had another guy roll to the middle of the field when he was supposed to roll over to the top at the boundary . There are pretty significant mental breakdowns , but all of them have nothing to do with John or Corey moving around . " <p> Is anything special planned to remember Nick Bell on Senior Day ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Mom and recognizing him out there . It 's something that I do n't think any of our players will ever forget , anybody in our program will ever forget . Really the most difficult thing I 've had to go through as the head coach . Wins and losses are wins and losses . We win a game , we 've got to go play again next week . We lose a game , we 've got to go play again next week . But that is probably the most significant thing that 's happened in my coaching career . It 'll be a great opportunity to thank Nick 's mom , who 's always with us , continues to support everything we 've done , and say another good-bye to him on Saturday . " <p> " Marketing has some things ( planned ) but we 're going to announce his name before the game and have him come out . " <p> What are some of the communications issues in the secondary ? " It 's about the repetition and doing it . Making guys talk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to your constant focus . It was n't like we did n't run that defense again later in the game and run it well at other points in the game . It 's that constant grind where the margin of error is so small . Everybody looking at that last game can point to the one thing that if they did , if they 'd have changed that one thing during the course of the game , we probably win--we will that game . We have to execute at a higher level . There 's times you can play poorly and some teams out there I guess that can make mistakes and they can just go win on talent alone to overcome those errors . When you 're playing good teams , you ca n't make mistakes and recover right away . " <p> When you look back at this recruiting from 4 years ago , what will you think ? " As a head coach these are the guys that decided on day one they believe in what you 're doing . That is always very , very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what we were trying to do here . They 'll leave as one of the most successful classes in school history . Not only did they believe but followed through on it as well . " <p> You talked yesterday about Arkansas still having top-ten talent ? " They 're absolutely that way . They did n't trade away all those players midseason . They did n't pull a Red Sox and dump the roster after halfway through the season . They 're all still there . They have a top pick in the NFL Draft at quarterback . As any team or any NFL team , you go get a primo guy at that spot then you better watch out . They have talented receivers around him and a good defense . They 're battling through injuries and they 're backed to the wall--they got to win out to go to a bowl game and so I imagine they 'll come out fighting . " <p> Have you ever lost more than three-straight games coaching or playing ? " Oh , I 'm sure . I coached at Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe we get credit for 4-6 . Oh , no , we get credit for 3-6 because Penn had some illegal players on their team . We lost three in a row while I 've been here . " <p> " I 've been very fortunate to win a lot of games , playing and coaching . But I have n't had all 13-1 seasons . " <p> Arkansas first-year or interim coaches have not beaten State ? " Well , that 's good news . It still does nothing for us on Saturday . All of those things , they all happen until it happens . " <p> Is it a new challenge trying to get the team back up after three losses ? " It 's always different . Every situation is extremely unique . As you look at this team and you look , we 're 7-3 . Obviously it 's very different than being 3-7 right now and trying to get the team up . So , if you disperse wins and losses throughout the year . I kind of always get back to the bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team and bring down why each thing happened . If we had started 1-3 and won six in a row , or started 7-0 and lost three in a row , how does it all break down ? I think none of that really has an effect . " <p> " You 've got to come out , you 've got to play and you 've got to execute on Saturday . If you do n't do that , then there 's not going to be a surprise with the outcome . There was no surprise on Saturday night . We played hard , we did a lot of good things , we moved the ball , we stopped them at times , we made critical errors . So there 's no shock with what happened . If we score touchdowns on both of our fourth-quarter possessions in the red zone , we win 31-30 . There 's no shock . All we had to do was score in the red zone . " <p> Were you worried when Tobias Smith went trucking after the interception ? " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unbelievable fluke , an act of God might have occurred , for that to happen ! No , I like that effort . Our guys train year round for their 12 , 13 , 14 potential opportunities to play in a game and they want to make sure they take advantage of it . " <p> But you were n't worried about his knee ? " Oh , the knee is fine . He 'll milk it . He knew he was going to get a day off today anyways . " <p> What is happening at Ursinus College ? " Pete Gallgher called me and told me they 're the winningest class in school history . Yeah , this senior class . He said can you say something nice about them ? " <p> What about your senior class ? " We were n't very good . Oh , geez , I probably lost more than three in a row when I was in college . We were n't very good . We had a winning record my senior year . That might have been it . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that ? " I 'll play them at 9 o'clock in the morning out in the parking lot . I 'm good . Scheduling-wise for us , we stay here and drive up there . The early morning kick makes it , with travel logistics , a little bit tricky . That helps us with the travel part . " <p> Ole Miss will be playing for a lot in that game ? " So will we . " <p> Will Ole Miss probably needing that for a bowl bid add some flavor ? " Probably for them . It wo n't add anything more to me . It already is pretty important to us . " <p> Who knows , maybe Ole Miss beats LSU first ? " You never know . I mean , LSU , look at their last two weeks . In this league sometimes , it 's not game one or the one game that gets you . It 's the second , third , fourth game of being able to do it week after week after week . It does

##608050 <h> The Bride I ( Never ) Wanted to Be <p> I run an indie-wedding website , so what I 'm supposed to tell you is that I grew up as a feminist tomboy who never imagined getting married . And I sort of wish I could tell you that story , because frankly , it sounds a lot cooler than the truth . The truth is , somewhere around the age of four , I discovered my parents ' wedding album on the bottom of their bookshelf and spent hours slowly paging through the photos . Not long afterwards , I announced that I never wanted to cut my hair again . <p> After some puzzling , my mom discovered that I thought her cathedral length wedding veil was her hair , and that you needed to have hair that dragged on the floor before you were allowed to get married . I 'd done some basic calculations , and decided if I wanted hair that dragged on the floor when I was an adult , four years old was about the right time to start growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I dedicated my first piggy bank to buying my ( Glinda-the-good-witch ) wedding dress , much to the horror of my feminist mother . <p> These are all funny stories , except I never exactly grew out of loving weddings , I just started loving them very differently , and then I got married . ( My hair does not drag on the floor though , just for the record ) . <p> Which brings us to the question : how do our past thoughts about weddings influence our actual weddings , and how do they shape our planning ? <h> Search the Blog <h> What You 're Saying <p> I have always preferred cranberry sauce out of a can to homemade , but that 's based on texture rather than flavor . My favorite slice is definitely the end , and anyone who stirs up 
##609952 <p> The main living deck of the voidship known as the Typhoon Maiden generally represents a lowrise city . The ceiling is some four stories from the floor , and living spaces are built just like free standing buildings within that space . This creates streets , alleys , crossroads , and courtyards , and gives the whole space an organic feeling . <p> Originally the roof was painted in pleasing shades of blue with some cloud and was lit from concealed lamps that simulated a normal terrestrial pattern . However , over the years the roof has become dirty with smoke from cooking fires , pock marked from gun fights and generally stained to a sepia colour through countless exhalations and no maintenance ( much like the polluted atmosphere of Earth , I guess ) . Many of the lamps have expired and have never been replaced , leaving a variable lighting system of some electric light and predominantly local solutions such as burning torches . <p> Architecturally the orginal design of the city was based on psychosocial engineering principles to make the spaces pleasant for human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , with walled courtyards , centralised fountain squares , and numerous nooks and crannies , balconies , stairways and ' hidden treasures ' . It is a very ' human ' environment , consciously mimicing the structures of the distant past that grew from organic action rather than cold calculation of efficiency . This irony : planning to look unplanned , produces many side effects . At the simplest level the designer 's goals were achieved . Humans live and move in the spaces provided , discovering and creating ' homes ' and finding privacy in a very densely occupied area . On the other hand the same town planning principles produces havens for filth , dark corners where murders can occur , and an almost endless choice of warrens where the venal can congregate . It is a place where washing lines are strung accross the lane , where excrement is thrown in the street , where bodies are found in the gutter , where wild street parties end in druken orgies and riots , where you can get a great meal from a trattoria that you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where you can slip into a basement bar and arrange a robbery . <p> This is the home of the majority of the 18,000 crew of the Typhoon Maiden : a space 1.5km by 500m . <p> One 's accomodation is a reflection of your wealth and power . The trading barons , for example , have multi-story homes that have walled gardens attached , where they can retire under a comparatively high ceiling and hold their parties or just meditate . The poor , of course , can be found in limited comfort apartments in one of the crumbling , sweating brown-stones . <p> I 'll try to be more specific on some of the streets , shops and houses in the future . But that will do for a general impression now . <p> Along the sides of the city , closest to the outer hull , runs a pair of canals . These canals collect the ' rain ' water that is periodically sprayed over the city to clean it , and also any other waste water of products that is ejected from the houses . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it is returned to the engine spaces for sterilisation and recycling back into the general use water . Gigantic pumps force the ' clean ' water to the nose of the ship , producing a constant flow down the lateral canals . It is a popular place , therefore , for little boys to sail boats , lovers to sit beside , and for use as a dumping spot for bodies . <p> On the far side of the canals , over decorative bridges , access can be gained to the galleries that offer panoramic external views . These galleries make excellent private meeting spots and are popular places as the ship moves in system to view the planets . When in the Warp the galleries are generally shunned for fear that looking out might attract the attention of something that might want to look in . <p> Anyway , I like hats . I have lots of hats for different occasions . When camping I have a squadron of different straw and cloth and wool hats for the changing weather . Since I am now bald I claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . It is true that the Southern Hemisphere has a brutal sun . <p> For quite some time I have worn an Australian Akubra in the Great White Shark pattern . Which is basically a standard cowboy looking hat in a grey colour . Traditional , you might say . But this thing , after twenty years of beating , is falling to bits now . I need something new . <p> Years ago my Mother picked up a Canadian Mounties hat with the Montana peak . This is also called the Campaign hat or , as I knew it as a boy , the Lemon Squeezer . Turns out lemon Squeezer is a particularly New Zealand description . No amount of searching uncovers another culture calling this particular hat that name . My brother in law calls it a Scout hat , and the history backs this up . <p> But I like the name Lemon Squeezer . It 's irreverent . I also like the images I see of surviving Lemon Squeezers from the Gallipoli boys . The hats are beaten up : ragged , floppy brims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not perfectly symmetrical . <p> So my new hat to wear at barbecues and general for outdoors work is the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) Montana peak ( Lemon Squeezer ) . <p> These fellows are technically not historically accurate as there is no record of such a thing as Aztec ' Cayman ' warriors . But they are nice little models and fit my needs for a lost civilisation based on Aztec for the Bossa Nova steampunk setting . <p> Eureka have quite a few Aztec offerings and despite the somewhat two-dimensional posing are pretty cute . I have an 8 man squad of these planned , and two more in more mundane outfits . This should fulfil the requirements for a force to appear out of the jungle and cause havoc amongst the civilised forces . <p> Painting has been low on my priority list over the last few weeks . The +1 year check ups with the medical professionals have chewed up a fair amount of my mental space . And to celebrate my survival we went camping : sun and beer and cooking in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I am back to work and back to routine . My painting task list has grown to the extent that I am now being tempted by Cold War forces -- though probably incorporating alternate history . Now I need a 1:48 scale T72 and BTR70 ... at least ... <p> When you get to a certain age -- with wife and work and children ( responsibilities ) -- the opportunities for gaming become constrained . The heady days of youth are long gone , when I could spend a good 24 or 48 hours of solid drinking and smoking and playing . Now that my sons are getting older I foresee a time when gaming can return somewhat , but it is unlikely that it will ever reach those dizzy heights again . Greg and I have discussed setting up the gamers rest home , where big screens play nothing but old westerns and war movies , where nurses bring you neat drinks that you can nurse for hours while contemplating moves on classic boards . What a dream . <p> In the meantime , the following is a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . <p> Buck Rogers , a TSR fizzer . <p> Of all the TSR flashes in the pan , this is probably the best . Not only did it hardly raise a ripple when it was released , it is a truly clever system , set in a truly interesting setting . <p> I really fancy the inter-war pulp science fiction settings . Buck Rogers conjures up all those fears of Communism that drive the imaginations of the time . <p> Technically it is a fine narrative system decades ahead of its time . I 'd love to play this . One day , if the Fates allow it , I want to come back to the inter war pulp and develop it some more . <p> The Savage World of Solomon Kane . <p> It is no mystery that I love the Savage Worlds system and have a deep love affair with the darkly romantic late Renaissance . <p> This publication draws the two together in a way that makes me imagine interesting stories and exciting game play . <p> Next year , Alan and I plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurry up , clock . <p> Hrn . The most perfectly realised conventional RPG . <p> We nearly , almost , so many times just about actually started one of these . But circumstances were against it . The major experienced player had too-much background and was sick of it . <p> Nothing any of the rest of us could do was satisfactory , and he had no interest in running it . Consequently it died . Several times . <p> Which is a great pity , because it was and remains the most well realised fantasy world with an excellent crunchy though usable system . If offered , I 'd play this in a shot . <p> Advanced Dungeons and Dragons , 1st edition . <p> You 're kidding me ? <p> I most certainly am not . Back in the old days , when all this was new , I used to play this with my very best friends at high school . We fell out , of course . It was about women , naturally . But I have very fond memories of those times , and regrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shitty , clunky system , but it was serviceable . For the right crowd it could be completely playable . I have sooooo many modules and so much source material . All of the original edition core rule books . <p> In reality I would employ one of the rebooted versions of 1st ed that turn around the combat tables to a more sensible d20 scale . But I 'd still keep the class simplicities without all the skills and feat bull . To me , the original system was the fore runner of the Risus clich . <p> Rogue Trader/Fading Suns/Savage Worlds ( Metamorphosis Alpha ) <p> I mix the names because I would mix the systems . Elements of the Warhammer 40k universe are really compelling . Some of it is total twaddle . Better parts of it can be found in Fading Suns . <p> To play it , however , I would use a Savage Worlds system . <p> Does this really count as a category for this post ? A bit of this and a bit of that ? <p> From experience , very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure . Ideas are drawn from all sorts of places . rules are adopted or dropped as needed . Never have I been constrained by a ruleset : instead I have tried to focus on the rules that evoke the appropriate mood for the setting . <p> Space 1889 . <p> But not in a ' going to Mars ' kind of way . I 'd like to go to the Island of Kong . This is my Bossa Nova setting , around the general time of the Guerra del Pacfico . <p> Again , I would probably use a hybrid system . Elements of Savage Worlds or modifications of Song of Blades and Heroes . <p> Soldier 's Companion was a pretty conventional wargame system with the fantasy chrome pasted on . Lots of it is extremely useful . Many elements seem to be poorly thought out and unworkable . But rules to do not make a feeling -- they just either expose or inhibit it ... <p> In any case I would like to tell stories and play wargames in the late 1800 ? s Steampunk setting . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times have now gone , so I do n't feel like too much of a total arsehole in thinking about it . <p> Weird War II is a different kettle of fish from the usual fetishising of the Second World War . No chance of accidentally becoming a Nazi apologist when the subject matter is so obviously made up . It is a fantasy story with the clothing of 1940 ? s technology . <p> This game , like the Bossa Nova setting above , is primarily a wargaming aspiration . I have the miniatures , and this is the system I will use . <p> And that is the list of games that I would really like to play . The chances of playing any of them are slim in the foreseeable future . But the future is a slippery beast . All of these are playable as wargames as well as story telling games . <p> I 'm not the first brainwave to figure out that gambling games only work when there is real risk ( money ) at stake . If there are no consequences for failure then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , I played five card brag with my eldest son and a couple of his mates last night . The betting chips flew , and he bet and lost his whole stake on one hand . When called he was holding ... nothing . No winning hand of even the lowest order . His reasoning ? That he was bluffing and that presumably everyone else was an idiot and would just give it to him -- because he was ballsy . <p> We redistributed the chips and he did it again . He was not the only culprit . The others also seemed to have no idea of cutting their losses . They would stay in the bidding far longer than was sensible , simply because they could not make themselves stop . <p> This is the purpose of Brag , of course . It is a fast paced pub gambling game designed to separate mugs from their dough , and fast . In this way it is probably a game only for experienced gamblers , or perhaps gamers that have far better impulse control than teenage boys . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put five dollars in a jar to play , and winner takes all . The son sabotaged the game immediately and slouched off , taking his droogs with him , and that was the end . Subsequently he crowed that he had actually played a game with me , something I am constantly nagging him over . Thanks , mate , your momentary attention was worth the wait . <p> The Typhoon Maiden is a civilian ship , but this does not mean that it is without all the usual trappings of the authoritarian future culture of Warhammer 40k . People 's live are regulated by laws and stifled by corruption , surveilance and coercion . <p> There are three security agencies aboard the ship . They are the Criminal Police ( KriPo ) , the Security Police ( SePo ) and the Religious Police ( RePo ) . <p> KriPo is the largest force . They deal with typical criminal offences such as murder and theft , conducting beat-style police activity right through to detective investigations . Technically they should apprehend law breakers and deliver them to People 's Courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will take justice into their own hands , ' tuning up ' trouble makers and ' levying fines ' . <p> In a population of only 18,000 citizens KriPo might be considered a ' community policing ' outfit in that it is definitely part of the community . Almost everyone knows everyone else so it is difficult to keep secrets . However the idyllic image of the friendly beat cop fails to capture the true nature of these thugs with badges . The goal of all internal security is to maintain order -- not seek justice . As such , KriPo is better seen as the major gang operating the protection and extortion rackets aboard ship . They maintain order because they smash anyone else trying to set up a rival gang . Far from combatting organised crime , KriPo is the organised crime . <p> This state of affairs is tollerated by the senior crew members ( the aristocratic owners and plutocratic merchants ) simply because that 's how things typically work in human space . As long as stability is maintained then who really cares if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dues , keep your head down : everyone makes out all right . <p> SePo is concerned with genuine ' intelligence ' work both within and around the ship . These agents are the spooks and puppet-masters , spying on the inhabitants of the ship , intercepting their communications , listening in on their conversations , and collating huge files for future reference . Ultimately they are concerned with the health and viability of the ship itself as an effective city state . The ship is the SePo man 's country , and he ( or she ) defends it with every tool fair and foul available . Snitches are paid to provide information . All citizens are encouraged to denounce each other . <p> For all their repulsive snooping , SePo rarely take action . When they do it is often revealed as a body discovered in the canal , an event that KriPo generally recognise and quickly close the case . <p> The last agency , RePo , is the most feared . Technically RePo is part of the Inquisition . If ever put to the test , agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a visting Inquisitor , even above their own Navigator . <p> Staffed predominantly by the mutants and psychics of the Navigator 's department , RePo is concerned with the ' spiritual health ' of the Typhoon Maiden . Corruption by the creatures of the Warp is of course the most obvious danger to watch out for , but RePo are also alert for signs of disloyaty to the Emperor , and general ' defeatism ' . Denouncing someone to RePo is considered the ultimate threat . Anyone investigated by them seldom find the experience pleasant and most find it fatal . Luckily , they are a small agency , perhaps no more than 20 staff . They make up for this by using the denunciation processes to make the citizens do the work , the advanced surveillance techniques commandeered from SePo , and the extensive systems of secret passages and offices known only by the Navigator 's department to appear more numerous than they are . <p> Fear is their tool . Fear and surprise . Fear , surprise and a fanatical devotion to the Emperor . <p> Our extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long way from the truth to suggest they are game-players in the same way I am . My job is to introduce the game , explain it , and lead it to make sure they all get it . This extends through the classic games like Blackjack that we play every time -- and every time I need to explain it as if it is a totally new experience . That 's fine : not everyone lives for games , though they do enjoy the social experience every now and then . <p> As a vaguely socially engaged man , my brother in law thinks that he likes poker . All media tell him poker is the only card game to play . When we play Blackjack he tries to bluff on the grounds that he thinks he 's playing poker , and is astounded every time that at the end of the deal he has to show his hand totalling 27 and that somehow failed to win . <p> So I thought I 'd try to actually teach him and the rest of the family to play real poker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning hands was completely mysterious to them all , old and young . I had to print out a sheet showing the hierarchy of value and this sheet was studied more often that the actual cards . The news that the picture shows a pair of Queens does n't necessarily mean you have to have actual Queens , a pair of any two cards would do , was received with complete mystification . Then came the bidding . Who has to see who ? How much do I have to put in ? Everyone forgot where they were , who 's turn it was , and how much and why they had to add money to the pot . Returning again to the hand hierarchy sheet before trying to decide what to do next . <p> For game players this is no problem because there is a determination to figure the game out , getting better at it next time . The goal being to gradually build up understanding of the basics and then add the complexities of strategy and really get to the meat of the game . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive to master a game . They just want to sit down and play something in which they are in the action at once over a bottle or a glass . They want a game in which the young can feel like they are engaged and the old can feel they are being clever . They want something that works out of the box and does not tax their brain , with lots of colour and movement , that does n't trouble them with clever-clever big blinds and small blinds and rivers and straights and flushes and other secret society code words that mark the genuine ' insider ' . <p> I had to do something because if I had to explain one more time that you can not bluff in Blackjack and that Blackjack is not Poker , or had to try to run through a hand of Poker again , I think I might have gone mad . <p> Since I am a game player and a Renaissance history fan I knew that Poker is an evolution of games from that earlier era . Brag and Commerce are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with a simpler alternative that should satisfy the groups ' needs . <p> Remember the game in Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels ? That 's Brag . It is a three card grandparent of Poker . <p> My version runs like this : three card deal . Ignore straights and flushes . You are just looking for tree of a kind , two of a kind or highest number . Ignore the traditional 333 being the highest -- just call three aces the highest and roll down . Three cards dealt to each player , and three face up cards in the middle ( the Bastard Brag variant ) . Each player can swap out one of their cards for one in the middle , or they can swap all three cards ( but not two ) , This keeps going around until someone declares they are happy with their hand . The remaining players get one last chance to swap . Then the cards are locked in and the betting starts . All you need to do in Brag is bet at least as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , say Frank bet 10 , then to stay in Harry would need to bet 10 . John wants to fold so he throws out his cards and is out . Peter wants to be in and increase the bid for he bets 20 . Now back to Frank who has to bet 20 . Now if everyone stays in and just pays the 20 when it gets back to Peter he must pay 20 again , because that 's what the last person played . In this way bidding can go on and on , and will do so until the players drop out . When there are only two players left this continuing cycle of bidding can keep going until someone quits , or a player can ' call ' by bidding exactly double what the other player last bet . Then cards are shown . If the challenger 's hand is better than the challenger 's , then he wins , but if it is equal to or worse than , he loses . Winner takes the pot . <p> And it seemed to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a pair . Next time I hope to introduce straight flushes and straights , but I am alert for the eye-rolls that attend any ' new rules ' . <p> But even with that success we were left with the basic problem of Poker . It is the quintessential American game , and one sees the design philosophy through American board games . It is a winner takes all game . Players get knocked out and are no longer part of the game . This is more than just a game philosophy , it is a political and religious viewpoint . More than this , it is a right pain in the arse for family games . The purpose of a family game is to have a game with the whole family . Once a player is knocked out , and this will usually be the youngest first , they are disengaged , bored , disheartened : less likely to want to play next time . And this impacts the chances of getting to play again . The most effective way of making people want to play is to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for as long as possible . Sure , you might declare a winner at some stage , but then again you might not . This is Euro games design philosophy . Something my friend Richard would probably label Socialism . This is success measured by making sure everyone has a good game , rather than success measured by destroying everyone else 's evening . <p> In a family version of Poker , or my version of Brag , this is compensated by the winner of the pot spontaneously compensating the player that just got wiped out as a ' loan ' . There is no expectation of repayment . It is a bribe to keep playing and not throw a huff . And if games are just models of the real world , and a game that involves risking money is a model of the economy , and if American business practices are the dominant practices , and if the world economy is screwed because of the dog-eat-dog bloated debt situation , then ... well I 'm not sure . It 's just an interesting thought . <p> Bring Your A-Game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll still have a couple of new game reviews this weekend , but we 'll return with new feature stories starting Monday .

Back at the SGC , Hammond reminds Jackson that Apophis is alive and in a position to wipe the human race off the face of the Earth , but agrees with the idea that they need to know more about the Eurondans ' war . <p> If SG-1 initially notice the fact that the Eurondans are all of the white race group , they do not comment on it . However , Alar , makes several objections to the presence of Teal'c because he is " not of their kind " . O'Neill eventually suspects that this is not because he is a Jaffa , but because he is non-white . He prompts Daniel to investigate the nature of the war , and of the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population preserved in suspended animation comprises identical white Nordic -looking individuals . Jackson learns that the enemies , which are so feared and reviled , are known as Breeders . It is later revealed that the Breeders are called this because they had no respect for " genetic purity " , breeding without care or plan . Carter notices pipes extending from the bottom of the facility to the surface ( which did not make sense because of the poisoned atmosphere ) and realizes that to build a bunker of such size and depth would have required many years of planning and construction before this supposed " war " began . Alar replies stating the war was " inevitable . " <p> The Eurondans are all from the same phenotype , populating their race through planned breeding and even through cloning , ensuring the continuance and purity of their people . It was , in fact , they who had originally started the current war , poisoning the atmosphere in an attempt to kill off those who would not submit to their eugenicist beliefs on reproduction . Unwilling to support attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Eurondans , escorting Breeder bombers and attacking the shielded bunker which housed the command center and technology of the Eurondans . SG-1 leaves the facility as it begins to fall apart due to the Breeders ' heavy bombing , warning the Eurondans not to follow . <p> Alar frantically offers to teach Earth all he knows in exchange for safe passage through the gate . O'Neill simply turns away , stepping through the gate , and then orders the iris closed behind him . A slight impact is registered on the iris moments later . Hammond guesses that SG-1 was unsuccessful in obtaining Eurondan technology . <p> O'Neill : Carter ? Carter : Colonel , Sir , this is fifth incoming wormhole in last hour and a half . O'Neill : OK , I 'm two hours early . When did you get here ? Carter : I have n't left yet . O'Neill : Did n't I order you to get a life ? <p> ( O'Neill , Teal'c and Jackson are about to travel to Euronda ) O'Neill : You 've got that look . Teal'c : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The one that says , " I have misgivings about this mission , but deep down I know we 're doing the right thing ? " O'Neill : No , the other one . Jackson : Oh . <p> ( O'Neill is about to pilot one of the autofighters . ) O'Neill : Does this thing take quarters ? <p> The Eurondans show obvious resemblances , through their actions and racial ideology , to the Nazis during World War II . Their dependence on heavy water recalls the sabotage of heavy water shipments for the Nazi nuclear program , and the embattled bunker suggests the Fhrerbunker in 1945 . Further , Alar 's wish to follow SG-1 back to safety so that he might work as a scientist for them parallels the Allied use and forgiveness of Nazi scientists in the space race . Also the Eurondans ' racial purity and eugenics ideas and applications resemble Nazi German goals of racial purity and removal of all impurities through eugenics . <p> Mike Dopud appears as an unnamed Eurondan guard near the end of the episode when SG-1 decides to withhold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen at the beginning of the episode as the soldier 
##624851 <h> In the Beginning was the Command Line <h> by Neal Stephenson <p> About twenty years ago Jobs and Wozniak , the founders of Apple , came up with the very strange idea of selling information processing machines for use in the home . The business took off , and its founders made a lot of money and received the credit they deserved for being daring visionaries . But around the same time , Bill Gates and Paul Allen came up with an idea even stranger and more fantastical : selling computer operating systems . This was much weirder than the idea of Jobs and Wozniak . A computer at least had some sort of physical reality to it . It came in a box , you could open it up and plug it in and watch lights blink . An operating system had no tangible incarnation at all . It arrived on a disk , of course , but the disk was , in effect , nothing more than the box that the OS came in . The product itself was a very long string of ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave you the ability to manipulate other very long strings of ones and zeroes . Even those few who actually understood what a computer operating system was were apt to think of it as a fantastically arcane engineering prodigy , like a breeder reactor or a U-2 spy plane , and not something that could ever be 
##631851 <h> The Other <p> The Other is an individual who is perceived by the group as not belonging , as being different in some fundamental way . Any stranger becomes the Other . The group sees itself as the norm and judges those who do not meet that norm ( that is , who are different in any way ) as the Other . Perceived as lacking essential characteristics possessed by the group , the Other is almost always seen as a lesser or inferior being and is treated accordingly . The Other in a society may have few or no legal rights , may be characterized as less intelligent or as immoral , and may even be regarded as sub-human . <p> Otherness takes many forms . The Other may be someone who is of ... <p> a different race ( White vs. non-White ) , <p> a different nationality ( Anglo Saxon vs . Italian ) , <p> a different religion ( Protestant vs . Catholic or Christian vs . Jew ) , <p> a different social class ( aristocrat vs. serf ) , <p> a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different sexual orientation ( heterosexual vs. homosexual ) , <p> a different origin ( native born vs. immigrant ) . <p> The Other is not necessarily a numerical minority . In a country defeated by an imperial power , the far more numerous natives become the Other , for example , the British rule in India where Indians outnumbered the British 4,000 to 1 . Similarly , women are defined and judged by men , the dominant group , in relationship to themselves , so that they become the Other . Hence Aristotle says : " The female is a female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities ; we should regard the female nature as afflicted with a natural defectiveness . " <p> The group which is defining the Other may be an entire society , a social class or a community within a society , a family , or even a high school clique or a neighborhood gang . <h> The Other and the Outsider <p> The outsider frequently overlaps with the Other , but they are not identical . The outsider has the possibility of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very likely to be accepted into the group . The Other , however , is perceived as different in kind , as lacking in some essential trait or traits that the group has ; offspring will inherit the same deficient nature and be the Other also . Therefore the Other and the offspring of the Other may be doomed forever to remain separate , never to become part of the group--in other words , to be the Other forever . <h> The Other in Literature <p> The Other is a common figure in literature . If you took Core Curriculum 1.1 , you may recognize this concept in a tragedy like Medea . Medea as Other is doubly dangerous . For the Greeks , any non-Greek was the Other or a " barbarian , " and Medea is a barbarian . She is also the Other in being female ; woman , as Other , is often perceived as inherently dangerous . Medea justifies these views of the Other in the terrible vengeance she wreaks on Jason because he betrayed her and abandoned her and their sons . <p> Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works we are reading in this course ? <p> Is Hedda Gabler the Other in any way--as a woman with unacceptable aspirations or passions for her time and class ? <p> Is Jane Eyre the Other in any way--in social class , in her values and goals , or in her nature ? Consider her in the Reed household , at the Lowood School , in her position as governess , in her relationship with Rochester or with Blanche Ingram . If she is the Other , does she remain the Other or is she able to overcome her separate or inferior status and find acceptance ? <p> There is no question that the Blacks in The Bluest Eye are presented as the Other in society and that they perceive themselves as Other . In what ways is their Otherness manifested ? How are the children taught to be the Other ? What consequences do the blacks in this novel suffer because they are the Other ? <p> Similarly the Chinese mothers in The Joy Luck Club are presented as the Other in American society ; are any of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family relationships . The Chinese mothers perceive themselves as Other from their daughters , and their American-born daughters perceive themselves as Other from their mothers . In what ways is their Otherness manifested ? How are the children taught to be the Other ? How do the mothers become the Other to their children ? What consequences do the 
##637751 <p> Almost every year they are coming out with new kitchen products that are all aimed at saving us time and trouble . If you have a set of appliances that are a few years old , which might mean that you could be wasting a lot of your time already just by sticking with those old devices . If you want to take advantage of all the time saving ideas then here are some of the latest kitchen appliances that are available now : <p> Interactive Touchscreen Kitchen Countertops - The kitchen countertop from Intel called Oasis is straight out of the movies . It is an interactive device that helps you in cooking and in providing you with nutritional information about the ingredients that you will be using . All you have to do is to place the ingredients on the countertop and information about it will show on the screen . The information consists of nutritional data and the best means of preparing those . <p> Fagor Multicooker- This device is perfect for you if you are short on space . It is a combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means if you do not have the space to store all three types of kitchen appliances , then you can just get this single multipurpose device . The great thing about it is that it has various settings for each set of function that you might need . <p> Computerized Grocery List - If you hate wasting your time in making trips to the grocery , then this is the device for you . When a product is running low in your kitchen , all you have to do is to scan the barcode on the packaging of the product and the machine will automatically update your grocery list . This means that you would know what it is exactly that you need . <p> Oster 3 in 1 Hand Blender , Mini Chopper and Electric Knife - Combining the functions of several devices into one machine is the way to go in the kitchen of the future . This machine from Oster puts together several functions that used to take three or more devices . Aside from the time that it would save you , this innovation can also save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the guessing out of cooking . When you scan a package of food on the device , it will automatically pick the right kind of setting that is needed for cooking it . That can save you a lot of time and wasted food . <p> We tend to take our furniture for granted until the time comes when we have to buy some new ones or we have to move them around . We do n't really think about them that much . But when we have to decide on what type of furniture to acquire and if removalists are requred , there are a couple of things that we need to consider . <p> Types of Furniture - There are several ways of classifying furniture . The most common would be by the type of material used in the construction or manufacture . Then there is through the kind of use that we have for them . Here are the different types of furniture according to their uses : <p> Seating -Sofas usually take up the focal point in the living room . They should be comfortable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they should also look good so they would not bring down the look of the place . Sofas can be made according to different styles and they can range from very heavy to light . Their unwieldy size however makes it impossible for a single person to carry them around . <p> Media- This type of furniture is rather new and they are all designed for holding various devices of electronics such as television sets , computers and home entertainment systems . Usually made from wood they are easy to move around on their own , but when loaded with electronic devices , you would n't be able to budge them . <p> Accents - These are the small pieces of furniture that are used for adding a certain touch to a spot in a room . They include coffee tables and side tables . Most of the times these pieces are also made from wood and since these are quite small they are easy to move around . <p> Bedroom - These are the furniture that belong to the bedroom . These would include beds and dressers and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of home furnishing to move around . In fact , it pretty much stays in the same place . <p> Storage- Cabinets and shelves are mostly made from wood . Some of them are fixed so they can not be moved around . <p> As to the different types of furniture according to the material used in its construction , wooden furniture are still the easiest to move around because they are a lot lighter than those made from other materials that are used for furniture construction such as metal . Plastic or vinyl furniture might be lighter but few people use those . <p> Usually we would prefer to have a professional take care of most of the home improvement projects that we want to be done in our homes . That 's when we want the work to be of the best quality that is possible , which is most , if not all the time . There are some tasks however that might seem too simple and too small for us to hire another person to do it and there are also times when we would want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs for example that would have to be dome immediately , because waiting for a repairman to do it would mean the loss of money and resource , or it could be that not repairing it right away could mean more trouble . Let 's say there is a leaking pipe in your house . Not repairing that would mean allowing some water damage to happen . If you have to wait for a plumber to come over , then too much water could be wasted already . <p> That 's why it pays off to know how to do certain tasks and we are not going into the realm of being a handyman for the sake of being a real man , which for some is a pretty big deal already . So if you would like to start doing home improvement projects on your own , here are some of the stuff that you are going to need : <p> Tools - You need to have a basic set of tools before you can start repairing anything or making anything in your place . You ca n't do those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your house then you can start with a set of the most basic one . You should get a hammer , a saw , pliers , screwdrivers and a measuring tape . There are so many more , but you can begin with those . <p> Skills- If you have the tools then you need the skill to use those as well . You should n't be an expert , but some familiarity would be required , if you want to be successful with whatever home project that you want to accomplish . <p> Planning- With the right tools and the right skills , all you need now is the ability to plan all of the tasks that you need to do . Just look around at your place and look for the tasks that have to be done . Once you have identified that you can start working on it right away . <p> C ongratulations for finally deciding on building your very own crafting project . You would be starting to explore a wonderful of handicraft and this is just the start . Your choice of starting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are relatively small and easy to construct as compared with other projects . It would also not require a great amount of woodworking skills or experience . <p> A breadbox is more than just a storage space for baked products . It is also useful for preventing these products from going stale too soon and for reducing the amount of clutter that you might have in the kitchen . <p> Lay one of the 12 inch x 15 inch pieces of wood in front of you . Put some wood glue on the side of the piece and be careful not to be too messy . <p> Now place that are 12 inch x 9 inch pieces of wood to the side of the piece where you have applied the glue to form a U shape that is nine inches high . <p> Put some glue on the U-shaped piece , at its bottom . Place the 18 inch piece of wood on the table and take the U shaped one that you have then press it down on the piece that is on the table . Now take the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then press it down on the other side . <p> Allow the glue to dry for a couple of house . <p> Once the glue has dried , then you can start applying the hinges to the piece and then attaching the last piece of wood that you have to it . <p> You can then attach the knob and other decorative pieces that you would like to place on it . There are some ready breadbox pieces that you can get which can save you time . <p> Now your box is ready to use . <p> Maple would look really good for this kind of project . Now you have to remember that once mould gets to wood , it would be very difficult to get rid of them . It is therefore important that you do not allow bread to grow mouldy inside the box . <p> Garden beds can be especially useful when it comes to growing vegetables in a limited amount . The use of the bed , prevents weeds from the surrounding area to affect the garden , allows the soil to become compact and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , gives a barrier against pests and insects and allows a good drainage system for your garden . <p> On your part , this can be beneficial because you need to bend down a bit less with the bed being raised higher than the rest of the ground . In fact , you can even sit on the edge of the bed while working on your garden if it was built in the right way . <p> Raised garden beds are different from planters , which are actual containers that have bottoms . Planters are more like oversized pots . Garden beds on the other hand are areas where the soil is raised by holding them back with some material . <p> Here is a guide on how you can make your own raised garden bed : <p> First step is to find an ideal location for the bed . It should be in an accessible spot that has good drainage and has enough lighting . It should not be in the way of a path . <p> Mark out the area . A 3 feet by 6 feet bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide enough for you to be able to reach the middle of the bed . <p> Mark the spot and then clean out the weeds and the stones from it . Start digging along the outline . You should dig out the whole section that you have marked out . You should just dig deep enough in order to bury the walling material that you would be using . <p> There are several materials that you can use for the wall of the bed . The most convenient one to use would be pieces of lumber cut to the dimensions of the bed . You can also use stones if you want . <p> Place a special fabric meant to prevent the growth of weeds at the bottom of the bed . You should make sure that it covers the whole space of the bed . <p> You can then start putting in the soil for the garden . Ideally it should be 1-2 feet in height . A higher bed would work but that would require a great amount of soil <p> It would help if you know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be too much of a hassle , if you would have to hire someone every time something breaks down or something needs repairing in your place . That is why you should have some basic DIY skills or you would be dependent on others . <p> You do n't have to learn anything fancy . It is enough that you know how to perform basic repair skills in or order to maintain your home and for you to accomplish the most basic of DIY projects that you might to start on . In order for you to perform basic projects , you need tools . It would help a lot if you have a complete set of all the tools used by professionals , but if you are just starting out , then having just the most basic and useful of them would help . So here are four of the most useful and necessary tools that any DIY enthusiast should own : <p> Hammer- Most maintenance work would require you applying some force and for that a hammer would come in very handy . Make sure that you pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling nails , old screws and other items that have been embedded into the wood . This tool can be a very handy piece of tool . <p> Screwdriver- A great number of items at home are secured by screws and so this tool is very useful when it comes to prying them open and setting them loose . There are two types of screwdriver , the flathead and the Phillips . You should get one that has a replaceable bit since both are equally needed . <p> Pliers - This is a multipurpose tool . It can be used for gripping and for applying force and pressure . You should never go without one , because the time will surely come when you are going to need it . There are several types of pliers but if you have to pick one go for the heavy duty type . <p> Measuring Tape - Most if not all DIY starts with getting accurate measurements and if you ca n't get them , you probably would n't be able to have the kind of results that you want . You should go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by home builders . <p> These are just four of the 
##639752 <p> The land based barramundi fishing around CBD in Darwin City . Barramundi fishing is much defferent from the fishing I was used to in the other fishings . I 've been obsessed with fishing Barramundi ever since I caught a wild one the first time I tried it . Now , I suggest " ROCK HAZARD BARRAMUNDI FISHING " <h> WATER TEMPERATURE <p> I arrived at the conclusion that Barramundi could adapt themselves to the change in their surroundings in water temperature at the change of seasons , but the adaptation to the sudden changing water temperatures were not swift in action . <p> Originally , Barramundi ca n't maintain an even-body temperature to the sudden changing water temperatures . <p> Therefore , they are very sensitive to heat and cold , especially very cold and ascending water temperature . Once the body temperature went down , the metabolism also went down , and then Barramundi did n't feel hungry so much temporary . This situation happened in May . <p> On the other hand , Barramundi go to the deeper water when they feel the ascending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sudden water-temperature change . <p> The stable water temperature is ideal for our fishing . <p> Even under the condition of a very cold water , they start biting lures once the water temperature became stable again . <p> Barramundi 's quiet seasons were in March , May and September . <p> Especially , September was the quietest time for catching Barramundi . <p> I could n't catch many Barramundis in September every year . March was told as Run-off in the wet land , but much quieter than April on the shore . May was n't very bad , but quieter than June , July . <p> However , once the water temperature became stable , Barramundi became very active . <p> Under the condition of the cold water , Barramundi changed into silver-white body . This silver-white body itself suited the cold water . Of course , the differences depend on the individual Barramundi . <p> Location : Shallow water on the shore <h> RAINY SEASON <p> Since we are in the rainy season anglers obviously have to contend with plenty of rain . <p> It 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inshore saltwater habitats after a big rain on the land . <p> The low salinity levels and dirty water put off the bait and the predators , and drive them away from where they can be easily targeted on foot . <p> That means it 's very hard to catch barramundi on the shore around Darwin city straight after a big rain . <p> However , barramundi can live in both fresh and salt water . <p> Therefore we can catch barramundi after a big rain in purely freshwater environments . <p> This is because we can find bait fishes , shrimp and crayfish that live in most freshwater habitats even after rain . <p> It 's very hard to find such a freshwater environment in the region of Darwin City . <p> I still fish the shore when it is rainy , but it is not the ideal time . <p> In my experience , the best time for catching many good-size saltwater barramundi from the shore in the rainy season is when we have had no rainy for 24 hours . <h> THE BEST TIDE <p> Any tides are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But too fast or too slow water current or very wavy water should be avoided . I try to find the places at any tides as follows , <p> For catching " Sea Barramundi " on the shallow water on the shore , ? Each fishing point has the best tide . ? Each tide timing has the best fishing point . ? The best tide shifts with the best fishing point every hour . " Sea Barramundi fishing " is an another thing from " River Barramundi fishing " . <h> THE BEST MOON <p> The phases of the moon New moon , crescent moon , half moon , gibbous moon and full moon . <p> As a result , I could catch many Sea Barramundi at any phases of the moon by land based on the shallow water on the shore . If I must find something good to say about the phases of the moon , I 'd mention the full moon 's safe situation . <p> " Sea Barramundi fishing " is OK at any phases of the moon . <h> SHORE BARRAMUNDI <p> Barramundi will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bigger ones will pick on the smaller or weaker ones . <p> That 's why small Barramundi prefer to form a grroup with other small Barramundi . <p> Barramundis feed when they 're hungry . When they are in the feeding mood , they will strike at anything that resembles the food in their native water . <p> It is easiest to catch Barramundis that are traveling in a group in an area that has their favorite water temperature . <p> They will strike at any lures when encountered under these conditions . <p> But it 's very difficult to catch Barramundi that is acting independently . I need really good lures to fool a wary fish . <h> BAIT ON THE SHORE <p> Mullet is the best bait on the shore . <p> SQUIDGY FISH/SILVER FOX <p> Above picture shows Sea Barramundi 's baits in the rainy season on the shore . Spotted Butter fish and crabs . <h> DOUBLE HOOKS <p> Double hooks , double the fun , half the snags . <p> Double hooks have been fairly uncommon in the Northern Territory . However , double hooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as for a wide variety of bait applications . Double hooks have more merits than I have expected . <p> Double hooks are very good for the shore based fishing on lures . It 's simply good for snag proof fishing . I do n't want to lose any more lures . <p> It 's also very convenient because I can change the hooks over without the split-rings or split-ring pliers . <p> Finally , I can cast my lure into the snag with confidence . <h> MY LINE SYSTEM <p> Baitcast reel <p> Main line : FINS PE30LB-50LB <p> POWER PRO PE30LB-50LD <p> Leader Line : Floating 160cm SCHNEIDER 0.55mm-0.70mm <p> JINKAI 0.66mm Knot:The Kaneit Knot <p> Spinning reel <p> Main line : FIRELINE CRYSTAL 14LB <p> Leader line : Floating 160cm SCHNEIDER 0.50mm Knot:The Kaneit Knot <p> I have n't had any troubles with FIRELINE on my spinning reel . Mr. Ronald Voukolos recommended me FireLine as one of the best line . Ron is the highest experienced and skilled angler to me . An evidence here , <p> Ron caught such a big fish as above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above picture from Matt 's Iphone . That means that Ron does n't know his picture is here . ? ? ( * ? - ? ) v Thanks ! ! <h> THE KANEIT KNOT ? <p> The kaneit knot was described in the Sport Fishing Australia magazine . It 's a knot for joining the PE line to the mono or fluorocarbon leader line . The terrific instructional DVD Mr. Kane Dysart and Mr. Bill Classon demonstrates the kaneit knot . The kaneit knot was designed by Mr. Kane Dysart . <p> AFN " BARRA TACTICS " <p> The kaneit knot is much easier than FG knot and more beginner 's friendly knot . It 's very strong enough for any big Barramundis . I trust the kaneit knot very much . <p> The kaneit knot is very similar to the slim beauty knot . The Slim Beauty Knot uses a double surgeons knot in the mono leader , but The Kaneit Knot uses a uni knot . <p> The slim beauty knot is also very reliable and much stronger knot . But if you are not familiar with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the knot easily . <h> LURE TO THE FACTORS <p> " Match the hatch ! " And it 's very important to make some strike points to Barramundi fishing during retrieving a lure . First of all , Try to match lure to the clarity of the water . Second , Try to match lure to the baits . Third , Try to match lure to the depth of water . Fourth , Try to match lure to the size of Barramundi you are targeting . Fifth , Try to match lure to the angling pressure . Sixth , Muddy water ? ? ? <h> STRIKE POINT <p> SQUIDGY FISH on the shallow water , <p> ? Murky water : Steady retrieving <p> ? Clear water : Needs more strike-points <p> ? How : Casting and lure control with negotiating rocks in shallow water on the shore . <p> OPTION : <p> ? Stop and Go . <p> ? Touch and Go . <p> ? Needs touching bottom first . <h> LURE COLOUR <p> Your favorite colour should be your best lure-colour . Only the chartreuse should be very special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of the chartreuse colour . Normally , it 's good for wmurky and muddy water . But I use the chartreuse colour for a very clear water . <h> FAVORITE LURE #2 <h> FAVORITE LURE #3 <p> LUCKY CRAFT GUNFISH 95 <p> The Gunfish has a " walk the dog " action similiar to the Sammy , but uniquely different . The tapered body provides a tight walk that glides across the water , while the Sammy has a more sporadic action . When stopped , this bait can be twitched and popped to create a splashing , darting action . <h> FAVORITE LURE #4 <p> RAPALA FLATRAP 08 Softly slow retrievings &; twitchings <p> Originally , I did n't like RAPALA very much . But Mr. Phil Newton said that I should use RAPALA FLATRAP for the shore based barramundi fishing . As a result , I have caught many barramundi easily . Barramundi anglers must have RAPALA FLATRAP . <p> Moreover , RAPALA FLATRAP 10 is the best lure to avoid the backlash or bird 's nest when casting . <h> The original , BogaGrip <p> Boga-Grip is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made of stainless steel and high-performance black acetal thermoplastic . <p> Mr.Mark West is the first person who used BogaGrip in Darwin . He had used it for 17years . Unfortunately , he lost it with a big fish in 2009 . When a BogaGrip dropped into the water , it sank fast and deep with a big fish , leaving him with a sinking feeling and a deep hole in his very important memory . I understand it made him sad to think that he had lost his durable 17years-use BogaGrip . <p> Mr. Matt West is using BogaGrip for 12years . <p> The most durable fish grip ! <h> World 's Best Split-Ring Pliers <p> " World 's Best Split-Ring Pliers " This tool has really made that task easier and safer . Texas Tackle Now " PATENTED " and simply " THE BEST " .

##654151 <h> Colorado police officer killed by friendly fire <p> A police officer was shot and killed Friday by another officer after several agencies responded to a report of shots fired at a home in the Denver suburb of Lakewood , authorities said . <p> James Davies , 35 , was in full uniform when he was killed , police spokesman Steve Davis said . <p> Davies was in the backyard of a home when an officer behind a fence in another yard saw Davies , mistook him for an armed suspect and issued unspecified commands to the person , Davis said . <p> Davies was shot after he failed to respond , he said . <p> " Officer Davies , being in uniform , did n't think he was the one being addressed , " Davis said .

He leaves behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation has taken quite a tragic turn , " Davis said earlier in the day . " The words heartbreak and shock are just not adequate when you lose one of your own . " <p> Davis said there was a lot of confusion when officers first responded and numerous shots were fired . Multiple agencies responded and officers were warned to avoid crossfire , according to police radio recordings archived by RadioReference.com . <p> Davis said three men were taken into custody and were outside the home when more gunfire erupted and Davies was killed . <p> The name of the officer who shot Davies has not been released . <p> " I do n't know of any ingredient that I can put into this story to make it more tragic than it is , " Davis said . <p> A team is investigating the shooting and the Jefferson County district attorney 's office will decide whether criminal charges are appropriate . <p> Along with Lakewood police , at least four other agencies responded to the initial report , including officers from Denver , Edgewater and Arvada , and deputies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the officers were in the area investigating a complaint of a prowler . <p> Davis said handguns were recovered

##661950 <p> On an airplane this past weekend , I was treated to " Step Up Revolution " as an in-flight feature . I laughed out loud at first -- I 'd seen previews and it looked like something I 'd never be interested in . And then I was glued to every minute of the movie . <p> The plot itself was ridiculous . Emily ( Kathryn McCormick ) has dreams of becoming a professional dancer while simultaneously falling for Sean ( Ryan Guzman ) , a waiter by day who leads a dance crew called " The Mob " in elaborate flash mobs . In the end , the guy gets the girl , a city is saved and everyone hugs . Nothing new there in the world of cinema . The average Rotten Tomatoes review was 5.1/10 . <p> But the dancing throughout the movie is incredible . Yes , that 's coming from a guy who can hardly do The Macarena . But it only makes sense that " The Mob " receives a lead for a Nike endorsement when all is said and done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanding on its dominance and making a name for itself as a representative of amazing dancers . <p> There have been numerous other dance-based movies ( think " Save the Last Dance , " " Singin ' in the Rain , " " Saturday Night Fever , " " Footloose " and " Flashdance " ) , but dancing is also taking over the reality television space , video game industry and viral videos ( Oppa Gangnam Style ! ) . Dancing is also most definitely a sport , and any critic who says otherwise is probably as inflexible as they are ignorant . <p> Late last week Nike announced the creation of its Studio Wrap , expected to be released in Spring 2013 for a suggested retail price of $110 . The target is women who spend time in their bare feet doing yoga , Pilates and dancing . It provides added hygiene , grip that socks do n't have , and the flexibility to be a wrap , ribbon or flat . This is something Nike has never done before . A studio workout . You 'll be notified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Forbes <p> I write about the fashion side of the sports industry , from sweatbands to cufflinks . I got my start with sports writing at the University of Arizona , where I was a sports editor and editor in chief for the Arizona Daily Wildcat . Shaq once questioned the validity of my age . Rob Gronkowski and I once ate hot dogs together at midnight . I spent a day on the golf course with Richard Jefferson discussing the Kardashians . I 'm also busy analyzing digital ads for the Forbes Advertising 
##662750 <h> Surveys by country <p> In November of 2010 , Discover Magazine published survey results published by the World Values Survey which showed significant differences between the percentage of men and women who are atheists for various countries . 3 <h> United States surveys <p> A 2008 study by Trinity College found that women are significantly more religious than men in America . 4 In 2007 , the Pew Research Center found that American women were more religious than American men . 5 <h> Atheist PZ Myers ' commentary concerning atheist meetings <p> In June of 2010 , the atheist PZ Myers commented that atheist meetings tend to be significantly more attended by males . 6 <h> 2010 New York Times description of atheist meeting attendees <p> In October of 2010 , an atheists ' meeting was organized in the United States concerning the future direction of the atheist movement and 370 people attended . The New York Times described the attendees as " The largely white and male crowd -- imagine a Star Trek convention , but older ... " . 7 <p> Surveys suggest most atheists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Freedom from Religion Foundation found that 95 percent were white , and men comprised a majority . 8 <p> " <h> Prominent general atheist websites appear to receive significantly less traffic from women <p> The website run by the organization American Atheist has significantly less women trafficking their website according to Alexa and Quantcast. 9 10 The Internet Infidels website has significantly less woman trafficking their website according to Alexa and Quantcast. 11 12 The British Website New Humanist Magazine receives significantly less traffic from women according to Alexa and Quantcast. 13 14 Atheist Ireland also has significantly less women trafficking their website according to Alexa ( there is no web traffic data from Quantcast ) . 15 <h> New Atheism websites appear to receive significantly less traffic from women <h> Summary <h> Atheism and Marriageability <p> Studies indicate that atheists are a minority in the population . Studies also indicate that people tend to marry people with similar values or who resemble their parents or themselves . 20 21 In addition , the Bible teaches Christians not to marry a non-Christian ( The Bible also teaches a believer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married ) . 22 Also , interfaith marriages often have greater marital friction and interfaith marriages historically have had higher rates of divorce . 23 Therefore , it would not be surprising if atheist/theist marriages also have increased marital friction and higher rates of divorce since these two worldviews are so different . <p> Given that atheism appears to be significantly less appealing to women , atheists are a minority in the population and that people tend to marry people with similar values or who resemble their parents or themselves ; this would suggest that male atheists may find it more difficult to find prospective female partners for marriage . And of course , militant atheism might make matters even more difficult . <h> Atheism and rates of marriage in the United States <p> Christian apologist Michael Caputo wrote : <p> " <p> Recently the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life has published its mammoth study on Religion in America based on 35,000 interviews ... According to the Pew Forum a whopping 37% of atheists never marry as opposed to 19% of the American population , 17% of Protestants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociologist Phil Zuckerman declared concerning suicide rates : " this is the one indicator of societal health in which religious nations fare much better than secular nations . " Please see : Atheism and depression and Atheism and suicide <p> Vox Day declared that according to the 2001 American Religious Identification Survey ( ARIS ) " more than half of all atheists and agnostics do n't get married . " 25 <p> Marital status has a strong association with rates of completed suicide . Suicide rates are higher in the divorced and widowed than in single people , who in turn have higher suicide rates than married people . This protective effect of marriage on suicide is stronger for men than for women , although it is found for both men and women ( Gove 1972 ) . 26 <p> When considering any and every atheist condemnation of any action whatsoever it is of primary importance to keep in mind that they are expressing personal opinions about the act(s) they are condemning . They are merely telling you their personal preferences in the form of morality borrowed from the Judeo-Christian worldview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon unfounded assertion , and building a tel of arguments from outrage , arguments from personal incredulity , arguments for embarrassment , etc. 27 <p> TheAmazingAtheist is YouTube ' s most subscribed to YouTube channel produced by an atheist and as of February of 2012 it had over 280,000 subscribers . In 2012 , he viciously told a rape victim " you deserved it " and told her that her rapist " deserved a medal " . He also told her that she should try to relive the rape in her mind . <p> The inappropriate behavior which was has been directed towards Rebecca Watson by atheists is not surprising . In February of 2010 , the news organization The Telegraph reported Richard Dawkins was " embroiled in a bitter online battle over plans to rid his popular internet forum for atheists of foul language , insults and ' frivolous gossip ' . " 31 In addition , Richard Dawkins has a reputation for being abrasive . <h> Atheist leaders and immoral relationships <p> On June 14 , 2012 , an article entitled Atheist leaders and immoral relationships published by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " <p> The website Submitted to a Candid World is written by an agnostic and the website was praised by the prominent atheist PZ Myers in the past . <p> On April 20 , 2012 an article appeared in Submitted to a Candid World which declared : <p> ' Several of my close friends -- coincidentally , all extremely intelligent , math/science oriented , and leaders in the **31;10103;TOOLONG communities -- find themselves practicing and promoting an arrangement they term " polyamory . " Essentially , this describes a post-jealousy , highly rationalized state where participants date each other , and several others simultaneously . <p> In the ideal polyamorous relationship , one man is seriously " dating " several women , each of whom is in turn dating several men . ' 32 <p> " <p> The article Atheist leaders and immoral relationships further declares : <p> " <p> Several leaders of the " freethought " /atheist community are practicing and promoting polyamory . This is not going to help the poor reputation that atheism already has among the public . The Mormons promoted bigamy for a while and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Of course , atheist leaders engaging in and promoting practices such as polyamory is one of the many reasons why atheism has such a bad reputation in the world . 33 <h> Elevatorgate <p> Elevatorgate is a term commonly used to describe a scandal involving Richard Dawkins ' inappropriate comments made to fellow atheist Rebecca Watson . In 2011 , Richard Dawkins was widely criticized within the atheist community plus criticized in various press outlets for his insensitive comments made to atheist Rebecca Watson about an incident which occurred in an elevator . 34 Specifically , Watson was propositioned after an atheist event in an elevator by a man who apparently was a fellow atheist during the early hours of the morning and she was upset about the incident . Watson has written about widespread misogny within the atheist community and she has received threats of rape . 35 <p> Rebecca Watson post Elevatorgate wrote at Slate about atheist conferences : <p> " <p> Women started telling me stories about sexism at skeptic events , experiences that made them uncomfortable enough to never return . At first , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had a problem existing in male-dominated spaces . But after a few years of blogging , podcasting , and speaking at skeptics ' conferences , I began to get emails from strangers who detailed their sexual fantasies about me . I was occasionally grabbed and groped without consent at events . <p> I started checking out the social media profiles of the people sending me these messages , and learned that they were often adults who were active in the skeptic and atheist communities . They were reading the same blogs as I was and attending the same events . These were " my people , " and they were the worst . 36 <h> New Atheism movement and contention between men and women <p> Within the militant New Atheism movement , there appears to be a significant amount of contention between men and women with complaints from women that there is a significant amount of misogny within the atheist community and its leadership is too heavily populated with men . 37 38 This may partly explain why Western atheism is less appealing to Western women . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to Western atheism as a whole . As noted earlier , Wired magazine made the observation

Most asthma-related deaths occur in low- and lower-middle income countries . <p> Asthma is under-diagnosed and under-treated . It creates substantial burden to individuals and families and often restricts individuals ' activities for a lifetime . <h> The causes <p> The fundamental causes of asthma are not completely understood . The strongest risk factors for developing asthma are a combination of genetic predisposition with environmental exposure to inhaled substances and particles that may provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways , such as : <p> Other triggers can include cold air , extreme emotional arousal such as anger or fear , and physical exercise . Even certain medications can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beta-blockers ( which are used to treat high blood pressure , heart conditions and migraine ) . <p> Urbanization has been associated with an increase in asthma . But the exact nature of this relationship is unclear . <h> Reducing the asthma burden <p> Although asthma can not be cured , appropriate management can control the disease and enable people to enjoy a good quality of life . Short-term medications are used to relieve symptoms . People with persistent symptoms must take long-term medication daily to control the underlying inflammation and prevent symptoms and exacerbations . <p> Medication is not the only way to control asthma . It is also important to avoid asthma triggers - stimuli that irritate and inflame the airways . With medical support , each asthma patient must learn what triggers he or she should avoid . <p> Although asthma does not kill on the scale of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) or other chronic diseases , failure to use appropriate medications or to adhere to treatment can lead to death . <h> WHO strategy for prevention and control of asthma <p> WHO recognizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organization plays a role in coordinating international efforts against the disease . The aim of its strategy is to support Member States in their efforts to reduce the disability and premature death related to asthma . <p> WHO 's programme objectives are : <p> surveillance to map the magnitude of asthma , analyse its determinants and monitor trends , with emphasis on poor and disadvantaged populations ; <p> primary prevention to reduce the level of exposure to common risk factors , particularly tobacco smoke , frequent lower respiratory infections during childhood , and air pollution ( indoor , outdoor , and occupational exposure ) ; and <p> identifying cost-effective interventions , upgrading standards and accessibility of care at different levels of the health care system . <h> Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases : <p> The Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases ( GARD ) contributes to WHO 's work to prevent and control chronic respiratory diseases . It is a voluntary alliance of national and international organizations and agencies from many countries . It focuses on the needs of low- and middle-income countries and vulnerable populations

And they came into the country of Moab , and continued there . 3 And Elimelech , Naomi 's husband , died ; and she was left , and her two sons . 4 And they took them wives of the women of Moab ; the name of the one was Orpah , and the name of the other Ruth : and they dwelt there about ten years . 5 And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them ; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband . <p> 6 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law , that she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard in the country of Moab how that Jehovah had visited his people in giving them bread . 7 And she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters-in-law with her ; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah. 8 And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law , Go , return each of you to her mother 's house : Jehovah deal kindly with you , as ye have dealt with the dead , and with me. 9 Jehovah grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . Then she kissed them , and they lifted up their voice , and wept . 10 And they said unto her , Nay , but we will return with thee unto thy people . 11 And Naomi said , Turn again , my daughters : why will ye go with me ? have I yet sons in my womb , that they may be your husbands ? 12 Turn again , my daughters , go your way ; for I am too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have hope , if I should even have a husband to-night , and should also bear sons ; 13 would ye therefore tarry till they were grown ? would ye therefore stay from having husbands ? nay , my daughters , for it grieveth me much for your sakes , for the hand of Jehovah is gone forth against me . <p> 14 And they lifted up their voice , and wept again : and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law , but Ruth clave unto her . <p> 15 And she said , Behold , thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people , and unto her god : return thou after thy sister-in-law . 16 And Ruth said , Entreat me not to leave thee , and to return from following after thee , for whither thou goest , I will go ; and where thou lodgest , I will lodge ; thy people shall be my people , and thy God my God ; 17 where thou diest , will I die , and there will I be buried : Jehovah do so to me , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her , she left off speaking unto her . <p> 19 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem .

##694951 <p> PEOPLE The Baganda are the largest ethnic group in Uganda and comprise approximately 17% of the population . Individual ethnic groups in the southwest include the Banyankole and Bahima ( 10% ) , the Bakiga ( 7% ) , the Banyarwanda ( 6% ) , the Bunyoro ( 3% ) , and the Batoro ( 3% ) . Residents of the north include the Langi ( 6% ) and the Acholi ( 5% ) . In the northwest are the Lugbara ( 4% ) . The Karamojong ( 2% ) occupy the considerably drier , largely pastoral territory in the northeast . Ethnic groups in the east include the Basoga ( 8% ) and the Bagisu ( 5% ) . <p> Uganda 's population is predominately rural , and its population density is highest in the southern regions . Asians constituted the largest nonindigenous ethnic group in Uganda until 1972 , when the Idi Amin regime expelled 50,000 Asians who had been engaged in trade , industry , and various professions . After Amin 's overthrow in 1979 , Asians slowly began returning , but Uganda 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HISTORY Britain granted internal self-government to Uganda in 1961 , with the first elections held on March 1 , 1961 . Benedicto Kiwanuka of the Democratic Party became the first Chief Minister . Uganda maintained its Commonwealth membership . A second round of elections in April 1962 elected members to a new National Assembly . Milton Obote , leader of the majority coalition in the National Assembly , became prime minister and led Uganda to formal independence on October 9 , 1962 . <p> In succeeding years , supporters of a centralized state vied with those in favor of a loose federation and a strong role for tribally-based local kingdoms . Political maneuvering climaxed in February 1966 , when Prime Minister Milton Obote suspended the constitution , assumed all government powers , and removed the ceremonial president and vice president . In September 1967 , a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic , gave the president even greater powers , and abolished the traditional kingdoms . On January 25 , 1971 , Obote 's government was ousted in a military coup led by armed forces commander Idi Amin Dada . Amin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution to give himself absolute power . <p> Idi Amin 's 8-year rule produced economic decline , social disintegration , and massive human rights violations . The Acholi and Langi ethnic groups were particular objects of Amin 's political persecution because they had supported Obote and made up a large part of the army . In 1978 , the International Commission of Jurists estimated that more than 100,000 Ugandans had been murdered during Amin 's reign of terror ; some estimates place the figure much higher . <p> In October 1978 , Tanzanian armed forces repulsed an incursion of Amin 's troops into Tanzanian territory . The Tanzanian force , backed by Ugandan exiles , waged a war of liberation against Amin 's troops and Libyan soldiers sent to help him . On April 11 , 1979 , Kampala was captured , and Amin fled with his remaining forces . <p> After Amin 's removal , the Uganda National Liberation Front formed an interim government with Yusuf Lule as president . This government adopted a ministerial system of administration and created a quasi-parliamentary organ known as the National Consultative Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected widely differing political views . In June 1979 , following a dispute over the extent of presidential powers , the NCC replaced Lule with Godfrey Binaisa . In a continuing dispute over the powers of the interim presidency , Binaisa was removed in May 1980 . Thereafter , Uganda was ruled by a military commission chaired by Paulo Muwanga . December 1980 elections returned the UPC to power under the leadership of President Obote , with Muwanga serving as vice president . Under Obote , the security forces had one of the world 's worst human rights records . In their efforts to stamp out an insurgency led by Yoweri Museveni 's National Resistance Army ( NRA ) , they laid waste to a substantial section of the country , especially in the Luwero area north of Kampala . <p> Obote ruled until July 27 , 1985 , when an army brigade , composed mostly of ethnic Acholi troops and commanded by Lt. Gen. Basilio Olara-Okello , took Kampala and proclaimed a military government . Obote fled to exile in Zambia . The new regime , headed by former defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Olara-Okello ) , opened negotiations with Museveni 's insurgent forces and pledged to improve respect for human rights , end tribal rivalry , and conduct free and fair elections . In the meantime , massive human rights violations continued as the Okello government murdered civilians and ravaged the countryside in order to destroy the NRA 's support . <p> Negotiations between the Okello government and the NRA were conducted in Nairobi in the fall of 1985 , with Kenyan President Daniel Moi seeking a cease-fire and a coalition government in Uganda . Although agreeing in late 1985 to a cease-fire , the NRA continued fighting , seized Kampala in late January 1986 , and assumed control of the country , forcing Okello to flee north into Sudan . Museveni 's forces organized a government with Museveni as president and dominated by the political grouping called the National Resistance Movement ( NRM or the " Movement " ) . <p> A referendum was held in March 2000 on whether Uganda should retain the Movement system , with limited operation of political parties , or adopt multiparty politics . Although 70% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was widely criticized for low voter turnout and unfair restrictions on Movement opponents . Museveni was reelected to a second 5-year term in March 2001 . Parliamentary elections were held in June 2001 , and more than 50% of contested seats were won by newcomers . Movement supporters nevertheless retained firm control of the legislative branch . Observers believed that the 2001 presidential and parliamentary elections generally reflected the will of the electorate ; however , both were marred by serious irregularities , particularly in the period leading up to the elections , such as restrictions on political party activities , incidents of violence , voter intimidation , and fraud . <p> A July 2005 national referendum resulted in the adoption of a multiparty system of government , but in September 2005 Uganda 's parliament amended the constitution to remove term limits for the president , enabling President Museveni to run again in the 2006 elections . In February 2006 , the country held its first multiparty general elections since 1980 . Ruling NRM candidate President Museveni was declared the winner with 59% of the vote , giving him a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( FDC ) leader Kizza Besigye captured 37% of the vote , while the remaining contestants received less than 2% of the vote each , according to official figures from the Electoral Commission . Besigye challenged the results in Uganda 's Supreme Court , which ruled that serious irregularities had occurred but were not significant enough to alter the outcome of the elections . <p> On February 18 , 2011 , Uganda held its fourth presidential and parliamentary elections since Museveni came to power . Seven opposition presidential candidates , including FDC leader Kizza Besigye ( the Inter-Party Cooperation candidate ) ran against Museveni . On February 20 , the Electoral Commission declared Museveni the winner with 68% of the vote ; Kizza Besigye came in second with 26% of the vote . <p> GOVERNMENT The 1995 constitution established Uganda as a republic with executive , legislative , and judicial branches . The constitution provides for an executive president , to be elected every 5 years . President Yoweri Museveni , in power since 1986 , was elected in 1996 and reelected in 2001 , 2006 , and 2011 . Legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held every 5 years . Because of redistricting , the parliament elected in February 2011 grew from 332 to 375 members , including 112 special seats for women , 10 special seats for military , five for youth , and five for persons with disabilities . The Ugandan judiciary operates as an independent branch of government and consists of magistrate 's courts , high courts , courts of appeals ( which also function as constitutional courts ) , and the Supreme Court . Parliament and the judiciary are independent bodies and wield significant power . <p> Uganda maintains an embassy in the United States at 5911 16th Street NW , Washington , DC 20011 ( tel. 202-726-7100 ) . <p> POLITICAL CONDITIONS After decades of internal strife , Uganda has experienced more than 20 years of relative political stability and economic growth . However , rampant corruption and one of the world 's highest population growth rates present challenges to the country 's continued economic growth and political stability . <p> Uganda 's constitution provides for freedom of speech , religion , and movement . Press and civil society enjoy relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlawful assembly , inciting violence , and promoting sectarianism to curtail government critics ' freedom of speech and assembly . In 2011 , Ugandan security forces used live ammunition , tear gas , rubber bullets , and water cannons to disrupt opposition-led protests against rising prices , leaving at least 10 dead and many more injured . In September 2009 , the government 's restriction on the travel of the Buganda Kingdom 's prime minister to Kayunga district , combined with incorrect reports of the prime minister 's arrest , sparked 3 days of riots in Kampala that left at least 40 people dead and many more injured . <p> The vicious and cult-like Lord 's Resistance Army ( LRA ) operated from 1986 to 2006 in northern Uganda , where it killed tens of thousands of people , abducted thousands of children to serve as soldiers and slaves , and displaced approximately 1.8 million Ugandans . In 2005 , the Ugandan military pushed the LRA out of northern Uganda and into neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo ( D.R.C. ) . In December 2008 , the Governments of Uganda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation against the LRA in northeastern D.R.C. , dispersing groups of LRA fighters across the D.R.C. , Central African Republic , and Southern Sudan ( now South Sudan ) , where the group continues to commit atrocities against local populations . In 2011 , the United States sent a small number of military advisers to the LRA-affected region to enhance the capacity of the Ugandan and other regional militaries to pursue the LRA and protect civilian populations . <p> There have been no LRA attacks in northern Uganda since August 2006 . As a result , the vast majority of the 1.8 million former internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) have returned to or near their homes . Assistance from the Government of Uganda through its Peace , Recovery and Development Plan ( PRDP ) and from international donors has helped communities in northern Uganda rebuild and recover from the 20-year humanitarian catastrophe caused by the LRA . <p> ECONOMY Since assuming power in early 1986 , Museveni 's government has taken important steps toward economic rehabilitation and adopted policies that have promoted rapid economic development . The country 's infrastructure--notably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neglect--is being rebuilt . Recognizing the need for increased external support , Uganda negotiated policy framework paper with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the World Bank in 1987 . It subsequently began implementing economic policies that resulted in a consistent pace of economic growth . Uganda was the first country to be eligible for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) initiative and had virtually all of its foreign debts forgiven by the IMF , World Bank , and major donors . Growth rates in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 were 7.2% and 5.2% , respectively . Food prices rose dramatically in 2011 and average annual inflation was 18.7% , the largest increase in two decades . <p> The service sector was the largest contributor to GDP in 2010 ( at 50% ) . Manufacturing and agriculture contributed 26% and 24% , respectively . Despite their dwindling shares of Uganda 's GDP , the agriculture and fishing sectors provide approximately 80% of employment in Uganda . Uganda is Africa 's second-leading producer of coffee , which accounted for about 17% of the country 's exports in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparel , hides , skins , vanilla , vegetables , fruits , cut flowers , and fish , are growing , while traditional exports such as cotton , tea , and tobacco continue to be mainstays . <p> Most industry is related to agriculture . The industrial sector has been rehabilitated and resumed production of building and construction materials , such as cement , reinforcing rods , corrugated roofing sheets , and paint .

Most of Uganda 's known oil reserves are located along Lake Albert and the D.R.C. border , in one of Africa 's most ecologically sensitive areas . Uganda and several private oil companies had hoped to begin small-scale production as early as 2012 , but production has been delayed due to a capital gains tax dispute and a parliamentary resolution blocking new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potential construction of a domestic oil refinery and export pipeline are contingent upon ongoing feasibility studies and negotiations between oil companies and the government . <p> Roads are the most commonly used transportation infrastructure in Uganda , accounting for more than 90% of cargo freight and passenger transportation . Uganda has about 78,100 kilometers ( 48,529 mi. ) of roads . Only 3,000 kilometers ( 1,864 mi. ) are paved , and most roads radiate from Kampala . The country has a 321 kilometer ( 200 mi. ) rail network , much of which is not currently in use . Uganda 's road and rail links to Mombasa serve some of the transportation needs of the neighboring countries of Rwanda , Burundi , and parts of D.R.C. and Sudan . Entebbe International Airport is on the shore of Lake Victoria , some 32 kilometers ( 20 mi. ) south of Kampala . <p> FOREIGN RELATIONS The Ugandan Government generally seeks good relations with other nations without reference to ideological orientation .

In recent years , the UPDF has become a modern and professionalized force that has largely moved beyond the human rights abuses committed during its military intervention in the D.R.C. in the 1990s . However , there are still reports of human rights abuses committed in the UPDF 's ongoing Karamoja disarmament campaign in eastern Uganda , and some UPDF entities are alleged to have committed human rights violations with other organs of Uganda 's security apparatus against the political opposition . <p> U.S.-UGANDAN RELATIONS Although U.S.-Ugandan relations were strained during the rule of Idi Amin in the 1970s , relations improved after Amin 's fall . In mid-1979 , the United States reopened its Embassy in Kampala . Relations with successive governments were cordial , though Obote and his administration rejected strong U.S. criticism of Uganda 's human rights situation .

Also the author of Last Call at Elaine 's , Indian Summer , and Safe Harbor : A Murder in Nantucket , he lives in Manhattan . <h> More About the Author <p> grew up in rockland county , ny , son of ny city detective and the youngest of four boys . i worked as a bartender for many years , dating all the way back to the disco era and nylon shirts . late in life , i went back to school obtaining my undergrad at fordham u. , then my master 's at columbia j school . at columbia I wrote the proposal for my first book ' my father 's gun ' and my life has been anything but boring since . i live in mahattan with bernie ( my dog ) where i write and try to scratch out a living . if you want more info on me and updated blog visit my website : www.brianmcdonald.info <p> I read a lot of true crimes , partly because I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could possibly be prevented in the future . I have also worked in some criminal justice related positions and gaining a greater understanding of everybody on both sides involved in a crime is helpful . Therefore , a well-written true-crime book is both interesting and helpful to me . Unfortunately , this book is not that . <p> Like many people who follow true crime , I was already aware of the details of the Petit murders from national news media such as " People " magazine . I was suspicious of this book having been released before the killers even went to trial which normally does not bode well for the quality of the book . I bought a used copy ( as I often do ) so that if it turned out to be not very good , I would not be out much money . Good call on my part and I 'm going to be kind of wary of the next true crime book that St. Martin 's decides to go rushing out . <p> The actual crime takes up only a few pages of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper or magazines you already know all that . Most of this book is the Joshua Komisarjevsky story . As a child , he was adopted into a wealthy and prominent Russian family , but by his early teens appears to have been becoming your standard behavioral problem/ sexual deviant/ arsonist/ budding psycho . The book suggests that maybe this was caused by his not getting the proper psychiatric treatment by parents who believed prayer and sending your kid off to church camp was the answer ( side note : teenage Joshua has relations with so many ministers ' daughters and other church camp girls that I 'd be afraid to send my kid to one of those places knowing they might meet such a person ) or by alleged sexual abuse as a child by a foster brother . While these might well be contributing factors , along with possibly genetic factors , to creating the psychopath that Joshua obviously grew up to be , it 's simply not that compelling of a story . As someone else observed , we do n't get to know the Petits beyond what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much info about Joshua 's partner-in-crime , Steven Hayes . <p> I did wonder why Joshua and Hayes , fresh out of prison , would be allowed to be hanging around together after their release from the halfway house . Seemed like a bad idea to me as obviously these two committed more horror together than one would have been able to pull off alone . I also thought it was odd that prior to this crime , wealthy Cheshire folks are portrayed as leaving their doors unlocked and seemingly unafraid of home invasions when they not only have a penitentiary very close by , but also I 'm sure that Joshua was not the only " rich kid gone way wrong " in their midst . But the book does n't really explore these topics , and given that the book looks like a rush job I 'm not sure how believable its portrait ofthe community is . <p> My suggestion is to skip reading this and wait until somebody actually does a more thoughtful book about this subject , if that day ever comes ( hopefully after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concerned that this book would make people sympathize with Joshua Komisarjevsky , that seems unlikely . Much is made out of his fatherly feelings for his baby daughter , but by the time I was 1/3 through I was just glad the guy was out of the picture as he 's not someone who should be near any young girls and the poor little kid he fathered is likely to have a better chance at life without him around . <p> Controversy aside , this is n't a great book if you 're interested in the crime itself . I do n't think there 's anything wrong with people reading true crime ; I have always enjoyed criminal profiling and accounts of crimes and I feel no shame or immorality as a result.I understand the outcry , especially considering that the trial has n't reached its end , but the problem lies not in whether this book is " moral " ; I do n't dispute it 's honesty , and its integrity is in some ways irrelevant . It does n't go too far . The fact is : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramifications or a study of how a criminal and a crime are born . It is essentially a biography of Joshua-- without applied analysis . We 've all read this kind of thing before-- and here Joshua 's history takes too much precedence . After the reviews , I decided to purchase this item used-- and decided to make a small donation to the Petit 's nonprofit for triple the amount I paid . If you 're anxious to read about this crime , read pages 205-220 . If you want to read about the somewhat typical , escalating criminal life of Joshua , by all means purchase the book . It is well-written but dull . <p> This beloved family lived in suburbia heaven , until their home and lives became targets of two ex-con serial burglars : Joshua Komisarjevsky and Steven Hayes . ( Allegedly . As the men have not yet been convicted . ) <p> Written in a style reminiscent of Truman Capote 's In Cold Blood , McDonald does n't focus on the actual events of July 23 , 2007 , as much as he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on Komisarjvsky , as he was one member of this party willing to talk to the author . <p> Besides being published before trial , I was disappointed in the lack of a photo of the victims , with the exception of Dr. Petit . I had to search for photos online . <p> Fortunately , those are my only complaints and I would very much recommend this book . <p> ( While I respect the views of those opposed to this book , especially Dr. Petit , it should be remembered that if you boycott one media source that " makes money off the misfortune of others , " you must boycott them all : newspapers , true crime television , etc. as they all make money from such tragic events . ) <p> There always must be immoral people like you Frechette to add a certain illogical and prurient point of view to a discussion .

The volunteers age 17 to 24 will work in a variety of community-service programs .

Want to explore resources , activities , and solutions ? Click HERE to make change or LEARN MORE . <p> More than half of American teenagers and young adults volunteered last year , and the best way to enlist this group turns out to be peer pressure : Three quarters of people ages 13 to 22 whose friends volunteer regularly also do so , which is nearly twice the number of those who pursue voluntary activities based on their concern about particular social issues . <p> Those were the key findings of new research results released today Oct. 24 by DoSomething.org , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . <p> The study , based on data from 4,363 young people , found that the most common form of support by volunteers was assistance with fundraising . Thirty-eight percent of those in the survey said they helped with solicitations , prompting the study 's authors to conclude : " Young people are a secret weapon . A donation pitch from a passionate teen is way more influential than a cold call or that newsletter you were thinking about sending . " <p> The study also found a gender divide in volunteer activities . Boys were more likely to undertake physical activities such as environmental cleanup or working with younger children in sports , while girls were more likely to help the homeless and other needy people or to work with arts groups . <p> Among other findings from the survey : <p> Students in private high schools were 25 percent more likely to volunteer than those in public schools . <p> Seventy percent of young people from wealthy families volunteered , compared with 44 percent of those from low-income households . <p> Young people who reported sending out frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year than those who owned or shared a mobile telephone but did not text regularly , and they were 38 percent more likely to volunteer than those without mobile phones . <p> Despite the heavy use of technology by young people , few of those surveyed went online to find volunteer opportunities . Young people were 66 percent more likely to seek volunteer activities by talking to people than by turning to social media or Web sites . <p> The researchers say the responses to the survey pointed out many ways that nonprofits can do a better job of getting young people to volunteer . Among their suggestions : <p> Offer ways to socialize . A top priority for many young people in choosing volunteer activities is having a chance to interact with friends , especially those of the opposite sex .

" <p> Make volunteer jobs accessible . Proximity to home ranks second of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . The researchers advise charities to provide volunteer activities close to home , but not in the home . <p> Offer one-time or brief activities . Many young people are pressed for time , so offer them tasks that can be completed quickly . " Teens often decide to go last minute , avoid showing up early and almost never stay til the end , " the researchers write . " Being first or last is n't cool . " <p> Provide volunteer jobs in familiar settings . In recruiting young people , keep in mind the extracurricular activities they already pursue . Those on sports teams , for example , are more likely to want to help younger kids in recreational programs , while those who play musical instruments are probably more interested in working with arts or other cultural groups . <p> Focus on providing direct help to people . Hunger and homelessness are issues that many young people care about , the survey found .

" In the mobile age , they 're more accustomed to anonymity . " <p> Offer volunteer jobs with benefits . For high-school students , the No. 1 concern about the future is getting into college and paying for it , the survey found . That worry was a bigger concern than getting a good job , having enough money , the environment , crime rates , personal health , or dying .

##710650 <h> Speak Your Mind in the Next Version of Dungeons &; Dragons <p> Wizards of the Coast confirms the design team is busy working on a new version of D &D; . <p> To paraphrase Don Draper from Mad Men , when you do n't like what people are saying about you or your product , you need to change the conversation . That 's exactly what Wizards of the Coast did today by formally announcing work on a new edition of Dungeons &; Dragons has begun . The new iteration of D &D; does n't yet have an official name and , until it does , it will most likely be referred to as 5th edition , but what it 's called is n't really important . For the first time , the creators of D &D; are setting out to create a role playing system that is compatible with - and takes inspiration from - every previous edition of the game . <p> " This project has one goal - to create a base set of rules that cover the entire breadth of D &D; ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dungeons &; Dragons development . " We want a game that anyone who has played any version of D &D; can recognize as D &D; and find the things that drew them into the hobby celebrated and supported . " <p> Even though sales have been steady and the weekly Encounters program is attracting new players , the public reputation of the venerable RPG brand took severe hit point loss after the launch of 4th edition in 2008 . " Every edition has in some ways met and in some ways missed my personal expectations for D &D; , " Mearls said , but he was quick to jump on the collective creative criticism from the gaming community 4th edition engendered as a net positive for the brand . " In every edition , D &D; is a creative exercise , and as such it is a game that players and DMs are expected to bend , fold , and manipulate to their own needs . In some ways , that nagging desire to introduce a house rule or create a unique setting are what give the game its spark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're focusing on the range of what D &D; can support and has supported rather than picking one style of play and focusing on it . " <p> The team at Wizards has turned over a bit since 2008 - promoting Mearls and rehiring one of the creative leads of 3rd edition in Monte Cook - and many D &D; insiders guessed something new was in the works . When I was invited out to Seattle to visit the Wizards offices early in December , I thought I might get a glimpse of their plans . I learned that not only was the design team already hard at work re-forging the game many of us play around the table but there is a company-wide initiative to win back the confidence of Dungeons &; Dragons gamers around the world . How ? By integrating the opinions and criticisms collected from fans directly into the rules with a long open beta test . <p> " We want to release a great product , one that fans have helped develop , " Mearls said . " Play testers provide a great sounding board for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building rules , and so on . " <p> Previous editions of the game had play testing periods , but Wizards restricted access to freelancers or those connected to the company and those tests were ineffectual at best . I was in a play testing group for 4th edition back in 2007 , and we submitted a 30 page annotated document of what we felt worked and what did n't work with the rules we played . Other than my name among the hundreds of play testers in the back of the 4th edition Player 's Handbook , nothing I submitted made it into print . Our feedback was summarily ignored , and Mearls admitted that was essentially true of all the feedback Wizards received from the 4th edition play test . <p> This time it will be different . Starting in the next few months , Wizards of the Coast will open the new rules up to gamers and actively solicit feedback to shape the game . They plan to leverage the relative popularity of the Encounters program - an organized event in game stores where players across the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventures written for the new iteration of D &D; using the new rules . Wizards plans to set up a website survey to track players ' feedback and get it quickly into the hands of Mearls and the team designing the rules . <p> " We want to give the community enough time to thoroughly digest each play test package , " he said . " Then , we need to make sure we have time to integrate player feedback into each play test cycle so their needs and desires are

##721950 <h> By ALLEN G. BREED , TAMARA LUSH and DONNA CASSATA Associated Press <p> Jill Kelley 's climb to the top of Tampa 's social ladder may be as spectacular as her fall from it . <p> Accounts of lavish parties at her bay front mansion with politicians and military generals have been replaced by reports of her family 's financial woes and other dirty laundry , and claims she used her close friendship with David Petraeus to try to further lucrative business dealings . Now , even her " Friends of MacDill " Air Force base access pass has been unceremoniously revoked . <p> The tangled web enveloping the daughter of Lebanese refugees , her twin sister , former CIA chief Petraeus , and Marine Gen. John Allen , who succeeded Petraeus as the top American commander in Afghanistan , has spread to include questions about a cancer charity Kelley and her doctor-husband , Scott , founded . <p> Although Petraeus ' affair with his biographer , Army Reserve officer Paula Broadwell , was the immediate cause of his downfall , Kelley and her relations with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of connective tissue for the growing scandal . <p> On Wednesday , a New York businessman said Kelley was introduced to him at the Republican National Convention in Tampa in August as someone whose friendship with Petraeus would help facilitate a no-bid deal with South Korea on a coal-gasification project . She would supposedly be in a position to help broker the billion-dollar deal directly with the Korean president , and expected a 2 percent commission , said Adam Victor , president and chief executive officer of TransGas Development Systems . <p> Kelley is an honorary consul for South Korea , a ceremonial position , and got diplomatic plates for her car . But after flying Kelley to New York to discuss how she could help , Victor says he concluded she had little to offer in the way of deal-making expertise or connections with Korean leaders . <p> The AP also learned Wednesday that Kelley attended an FBI " Citizens ' Academy " last year . It was Kelley 's complaints to an FBI agent about alleged threats from Broadwell that led to the general 's resignation last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next commander of U.S. European Command and the commander of NATO forces in Europe . <p> The agent was Frederick W. Humphries , 47 , a veteran counterterrorism investigator in the Tampa office , and he was among the FBI employees Kelley met during the academy , which lasted from Sept. 13 to Nov. 30 , 2011 , the AP learned . <p> Both Petreaus and Allen have been guests at the Kelleys ' 5,000-square-foot home on Bayshore Boulevard , which records show they purchased in 2004 for about $1.5 million . Jill Kelley 's twin sister , Natalie Khawam , also lives there . <p> The five-bedroom , three-and-a-half-bath brick Colonial with its stately white columns is on the main parade route for the Gasparilla Pirate Festival , Tampa 's answer to Mardi Gras . And the couple soon gained a reputation for their sumptuous and well-attended affairs . <p> Jill Kelley , 37 , and her husband - a cancer surgeon - are members of the Tampa Yacht and Country Club . <p> The relationship between the Kelleys and Petraeus began in late 2008 , when he came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a welcome party for him , and he reportedly watched his first Gasparilla pirate parade from the Kelleys ' lawn . <p> Kelley 's overtures to the military brass are , in and of themselves , nothing extraordinary . In fact , most of these civilian-military relationships begin innocently enough . <p> For instance , the connection of another local couple , John and Leslie Osterweil , with MacDill and CentCom started more than two decades ago , when a teacher at their son 's exclusive prep school asked him to take a general 's boy " under his wing . " That boy 's father was then CentCom commander in chief , Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf . Since then , John Osterweil has become a regular presence on the base . He counts Allen and Petraeus as close friends , and each has visited the other 's home . <p> " You know , a lot of people are enamored by people who are high-ranking generals and admirals , " he says . " I mean , a lot of people look at them in some type of a different light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friends . " <p> But Petraeus aides say Jill Kelley took it to another level , winning the title of " honorary ambassador " for her extensive entertaining at her home on behalf of the command , throwing parties that raised her social status in Tampa through the reflected glow of the four-star general in attendance . <p> Petraeus honored the couple with an award , given to them in a special ceremony at the Pentagon just before he departed the military for his post at the CIA , an aide said , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the matter publicly . <p> Aaron Fodiman , who 's been publisher of Tampa Bay Magazine for 27 years , said people like Petraeus and Allen usually do n't know anyone when they arrive , and that people like Kelley act as " the welcome wagon . " But while he described the hostess as " outgoing and effervescent , " he said her parties " were like everybody else 's parties . " <p> " Nothing different or special , " who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure . Have a caterer . Feed people . Give them something to drink . And let them mix . " <p> But behind the scenes , this veneer of upward mobility was showing signs of cracking . <p> Hundreds of pages of court files in numerous cases portray the occupants of 1005 Bayshore Boulevard as both litigious and financially strained . <p> The Kelleys ' investment in a Tampa office building went sour when a $28,000-a-month tenant balked at payment because of problems with the air conditioning system . The couple later defaulted on the mortgage and the property went into foreclosure . <p> An attorney who represented the Kelleys in that case , Barry Cohen , ultimately became the target of a lawsuit over his legal fees . Chase Bank sued Scott Kelley over a $25,880.56 unpaid credit card bill . <p> Meanwhile , Khawam , Kelley 's twin , has had legal troubles of her own . <p> She sued Cohen 's firm , where she was an attorney , claiming sexual harassment by the chief financial officer . <p> In court responses , Cohen said Khawam " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commission of perjury . " He cited a court filing in the District of Columbia that described Khawam as having a " willingness to say anything , even under oath , to advance her own personal interests at the expense of ... others . " <p> Khawam , who earned $270,822 in 2010 , according to a court filing , has filed for bankruptcy . <p> During a news conference Wednesday , Cohen said both sisters had been heard dropping Petraeus ' name often , though he never heard Allen 's name invoked . He said both subscribed to the idea that you should " join these clubs and have these parties and drop these names . " <p> Referring to Jill Kelley , he said : " She does what she thinks is necessary to be perceived as being important . " <p> Her apparent importance and connections were described to Victor , when the New York businessman was introduced to her . <p> " We went down to the convention to spread our message about coal gasification and I met someone who seemed to be very well connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Petraeus and someone who could deal with the president of South Korea . <p> In an interview , Victor continued : " It was Jill Kelley . She was a very vivacious woman . She seemed eager to assist us in our project and she confirmed that she was very close to Gen. Petraeus ... " <p> Victor said she talked about helping with a non-competitive bid . " And so that if the ( South Korean ) president liked it , as a favor to Gen. Petraeus , there would be one no-bid contract . Every developer likes a no-bid contract , or sole source . This certainly seemed worthwhile pursuing . " <p> Victor said his company flew Kelley to New York , first class , for meetings , and then she flew to Hawaii , allegedly for meetings on the deal . <p> They discussed her compensation , Victor said . " I said , what do you think a fair fee would be ? ' " And she emailed me back , 2 percent of the deal , " which he said could have amounted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work through others on the deal . " We decided that she simply was not a skilled negotiator in these large projects , she 's never been in these large projects and I sort of felt that I wasted my time , " Victor said . <p> In 2005 , the Kelleys established Doctor Kelley Cancer Foundation Inc. , with themselves and Khawam as its sole directors , according to the Florida Department of State . Its mission statement says the organization , which was based out of the Kelley home , was created to " conduct research studies into efforts to discover ways to improve the quality of life of terminally-ill adult cancer patients . " <p> In 2007 , the last year for which it filed paperwork , the foundation reported revenues of $157,284 to the Internal Revenue Service , all from direct donations , according to its tax filing . The document lists expenses totaling precisely the same amount , including $43,317 for meals and entertainment , $38,610 for travel , $25,013 in legal fees , $8,067 for supplies and $5,082 in phone bills . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's unclear what those services entailed . <p> Christopher Pietruszkiewicz , dean of the Stetson University Law School and expert on nonprofits and taxation , said the foundation 's filing " raises a lot more questions than it does provide answers . " <p> " I 'm not sure that we can come up with any conclusions about how the money was spent by the organizers of the charitable organization , but it does give us a sense about how $157,000 was spent , " he said . " And I do think it raises some issues that either the Internal Revenue Service or the State of Florida may be interested in looking at . " <p> The Tampa Bay Times reported Wednesday that as late as February 2010 , Jill Kelley was soliciting contributions in the foundation 's name to fund a dinner for the homeless . The paper cited an email in which she asked prospective donors for " in kind ' donations ( i.e. more food , drinks , banners , decorations ) " and noted that the charity was a " tax write-off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of emails and other documents - some characterized as " inappropriate communications " - between Jill Kelley and Allen , MacDill 's commander on Tuesday revoked her access pass . <p> Kelley was issued the pass , one of about 800 handed out under a program to promote interaction with the civilian population , in November 2010 , according to a military source , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to comment on the situation . It was renewed this past February . <p> Several months ago , Jill Kelley was appointed an honorary local consul for South Korea , said Kristen Smith , executive assistant at the South Korean consulate in Atlanta , which also covers Florida . The license plate on Kelley 's silver Mercedes-Benz reads , " Honorary Consul 1JK . " <p> Smith was not authorized to say anything more about Kelley 's activities on that country 's behalf , although she confirmed that Kelley still maintained her position . When Kelley called police Tuesday to complain of reporters staking out her home , she cited her honorary position and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's FBI citizens academy , which Kelley attended , Natalie Shepherd , a reporter with Channel 8 in Tampa , was one of two media representatives also invited . Among the 30 people on the list was the head of the host committee for the Republican National Convention , a vice president of security for Walt Disney Corp. , and the Hillsborough County tax collector . <p> " She 's the only person on the list who 's just listed as her name , " Shepherd said . <p> Each Tuesday evening session at the local field office covered a different topic , such as domestic terrorism , international terror or cybercrime

##735052 <h> The Story of Patrick : A RDDC Student in Rwanda <p> " When you watch him dance , you can see he is dancing his story of change . He respects himself and the rest of the boys respect him because of the way he takes himself . " <p> The RDDC program is becoming more successful in its desire to help street children through the arts . It engages children in a physical activity with social rehabilitation , and it makes children feel worthwhile and able to do whatever they hope to do in their lives . Every child at FIDESCO ( the temporary shelter where the street children live during the RDDC program ) has his story , and every one of them is bearing a scar from his history . It 's hard to understand many of them ; they are unpredictable , which makes it hard to help them change their negative thinking about themselves . They can not see their potential in doing something or how their natural talents can be activated . <p> Patrick is one of the boys that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father abandoned his mom , and his mom is not able to take him to school . Since Patrick was not going to school and life was hard at home , he turned to the streets . I have been working with Patrick since he started attending the RDDC program at FIDESCO -- dance and IT training . At first , I could n't understand this boy because he could come and just sit alone -- waiting for something to start . Whenever someone would try to talk to him , he would just look at you and say nothing in return . He was always angry , but not lively like any other 12 year old boy would be . He was always protective , but would never fight back whenever the other boys would try to interrupt his peace . Instead , he would rather cry and leave because he was not used to them . <p> Actually , Patrick is one of the boys who has been living at FIDESCO for a long time . He never seemed to be interested in dance though . Whenever I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " yes " , but his body language was always showing something contrary to what he was saying . The most interesting characteristic about Patrick : he 's slow but he 's so courageous . He never gives up on something till he gets it right . During our dance training , he was not as fit as some of the other boys ; he was always challenged by the fact that there were some movements which he could not do . Patrick started coming to class earlier than the others , and he would start to stretch his body and move around doing some things that he had learned by himself . One day , during our training , I gave him a " hi-5 " after doing some movement . He turned to me , and said , " I know how it looks and I know that I have not done it the way it should be , so I need to do it exactly the way I see it when you do it . " <p> No one ever remembered Patrick when he first joined the RDDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director Rebecca , came to give them more intensive training . She taught them some choreography and she could n't believe that Patrick was the only boy who could do it better than anyone else in terms of expression and clear movements . She was so impressed . Actually , he won himself the title of " best dancer " in our class . <p> Today , Patrick is a very different person from the Patrick we found when we first met him . He reflects his vision of becoming a professional dancer . When you watch him dance , you can see he is dancing his story of change . He can now stand out from the rest and dance alone without inhibition . He respects himself and the rest of the boys respect him because of the way he takes himself . Not only has Patrick 's life been changed by this program , Patrick is one who we never expected to respond . This is a big success for RDDC . <p> Ssali Joseph Eugene is one of the Rwandan RDDC dance instructors that leads the FIDESCO program @ @ @

One of the actual crooners is singer and voice-over artist Elizabeth Daily . <p> Rose was originally written off near the end of season four by having her move to London , because Melanie Lynskey had landed a part on the FOX pilot , Drive When that show was canceled , she was allowed to return to Two and a Half Men . <p> It 's never mentioned as to what Judith does for a living .

In later seasons , his ringtone is a possibly covered version of Fifth Dimension 's " Up , Up , and Away . " One of the show 's running gags is Alan 's cell phone ringing at unexpected times and places . <p> Watch the opening theme song during the later seasons . During the song , Angus T. Jones appears as young as he was during the First Season , but at the end of the song in later season , he " morphs " into the age he is for that particular season . <p> Filming had to be interrupted during season 7 , when Charlie Sheen checked himself into rehab in February 2010 .

##745650 <p> If a bill being proposed by a group of senators makes it through Congress , Facebook and many other high-profile technology stocks may never have to go public at all . That might make CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg happy , but it could also derail the tech-IPO train . <p> As described by Dan Primack at Fortune magazine , the draft bill proposed by a group including Reps . David Schweikert ( R-AZ ) and Jim Himes ( D-CT ) would significantly water down the current " 500 investor " rule , an SEC regulation that currently requires companies that have more than 500 shareholders to file public documents ( Primack has some more details about the bill and a Q &A; with Schweikert here ) . <p> Although this rule does n't actually force a private company to do an IPO or issue public shares ( as some people mistakenly assume ) many companies -- including Google -- have issued public share as a result of the rule . The thinking seems to be that if you have to disclose your finances in public filings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just throw in the towel and go public . <p> As Primack describes it , the bill would effectively blunt the force of the 500-investor rule in several ways , including : <p> It would double the threshold for the rule to 1,000 shareholders . <p> Employees who own shares would not be counted for the purposes of the rule . <p> " Accredited investors , " such as pension funds and those with a net worth of more than $1 million , would not be counted as part of the 1,000 number . <p> At the same time , however , the regulator has been under pressure for some time to either remove or blunt the force of the 500-investor rule , which critics -- including venture capitalists such as Twitter financier Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures -- say is unnecessarily restrictive when it comes to the financing options available to companies . And there have been some signs that the SEC is open to doing this , including comments from the agency 's chairman last month that suggested it is considering loosening the restrictions on when companies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to note that there are plenty of other reasons why companies go public other than the 500-investor rule . In many cases , the venture capitalists and other private investors who have financed a company through its early days of growth are looking for a return on their investment -- and only a splashy public offering can produce the kind of multiple on those investments that make it worthwhile for funds to do so . So even if the rule is changed or removed , Facebook may still go public . <p> However , with the kind of capital resources that it and other companies ( like Twitter ) can access through private deals similar to the one Goldman Sachs put together -- as well as private investments from entities such as Digital Sky Technologies , and secondary share-trading services like SecondMarket -- there is no longer as much pressure for even hot tech players to go public just to raise money or provide liquidity for investors . And that could blunt the force of any IPO land grab that Facebook was expected to lead . <p> All that bill would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed ) is delay the IPO . A company that is worth as much as current investors and speculators think it 's worth needs more liquidity to keep employees and shareholders happy . Also , at some point , the VCs and their LPs will want to sell their shares , and then there will be way more than 1000 non-employee shareholders . <p> But maybe a new company will come along and reduce the value of Facebook , and Microsoft will be able to buy it and combine it with Skype and their other non-software assets in a futile Intel-like attempt to diversify . And then an IPO wo n't be necessary . <p> In what universe would they pass up the liquidity of public markets ? Only public markets would allow them to recognize billions of dollars in stock sales across the multitude of current owners . SecondMarket and private placements have not been able to provide that kind of liquidity nor would they . <p> Furthermore , publicly traded stock is a far more valuable currency with which to buy things than privately traded stock . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay private and not have a bank account with $20 billion in it , I do n't believe the majority of his investors would . And for that matter , the people who bought all the stock in the offerings through GS , SecondMarket , etc. all want an IPO , not some hope that others are coming in privately . <p> Clearly your

Troops are massing on the border , and witnesses said they could see Israeli ships off Gaza 's coast , NBC News ' Ayman Mohyeldin reported . <p> The rocket attacks came just hours after Egypt 's prime minister visited the Gaza Strip to show support for Palestinians amid a cross-border conflict with Hamas militants that risks spiraling into an all-out war . <p> " Egypt will spare no effort ... to stop the aggression and to achieve a truce , " Prime Minister Hesham Kandil said . <p> " Palestine is the heart of the Arab and Muslim world and the body is not healthy while the heart is sick , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked Friday , where the Interior Ministry took direct hits and civilians died .

Israel then began shelling Gaza from land , air and sea . <p> Israel says its offensive was in response to increasing missile salvos from Gaza . Its bombing has not yet reached the saturation level seen before it last invaded Gaza in 2008 , but Israeli officials have said a ground assault remains possible . <p> " We are going to continue hitting Hamas hard and we will continue to strike hard at the missiles targeted at Central and South Israel , " Netanyahu wrote Friday on Twitter . <p> An Israeli ground offensive could be costly to both sides . In the last Gaza war , Israel devastated parts of the territory , setting back Hamas ' fighting capabilities .

Cross border exchanges of missile fire between Israel and Palestinian fighters in Gaza , have caused fatalities on both sides in recent days , but this is the first time that Palestinians have used missiles which appear to have the range to target Tel Aviv . <p> By Martin Fletcher , NBC News <p> TEL AVIV , Israel -- If it is in hardship that you can take the measure of a man or woman , apparently the same goes for a town . <p> Tel Aviv , long described as a bubble by other Israelis for its laid-back style and alleged intellectual distance from the country 's daily tribulations , got a wake-up call Thursday night . <p> For the first time since the Iraq war in 1991 , the sirens screamed , warning of a rocket attack , this time from the Gaza Strip . <p> The bubble burst big-time , if only for a moment , and if only for some . <p> Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst into tears .

That is a minute-and-a-half to understand what is happening and find safety -- better than some of the towns in the south , which have only a 15-second warning . <p> A cafe owner told NBC News that half the customers ran for shelter , the other half took photos . <p> One man told Haaretz he came from the south to Tel Aviv to escape the danger , and as soon as he arrived the siren sounded so he turned around and drove home again .

One man asked whether the public bomb shelters served espresso . <p> But there were serious concerns , too . <p> A shift ? As soon as the siren stopped most people dialed their loved ones on cellphones , only to find they did not work . All they got was a dial tone from the instantly overwhelmed system . Rumors , which later proved to be true , spread that reserve soldiers were being called up . Orders were given to okay 30,000 reserve call-ups . <p> It was always said that as long as Hamas only rocketed towns in the south of Israel , generally poorer and far from the centers of power , their low-intensity provocations could continue for years .

ET : AMMAN , Jordan -- Around 2,000 people called for the removal Jordan 's King Abdullah at a rally in downtown Amman on Friday in protest at fuel price hikes , in a marked escalation of street anger in the third day of demonstrations in the Western-backed kingdom . <p> " Go down Abdullah , go down , " the protesters Friday chanted as police , some in riot gear , largely stayed away from crowd , near the main Husseini Mosque . <p> The crowed also chanted " The people want the downfall of the regime , " the rallying cry of the Arab Spring uprisings that have shaken the Middle East and toppled leaders in Tunisia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shame .

But those gatherings were peaceful and the security forces did not use weapons . <p> Demonstrators sometimes chant against Abdullah but there seems to be little enthusiasm for revolution .

They supply the army and security forces with recruits and form the backbone of support for the ruling Hashemite dynasty . <p> Some politicians say the monarch has been forced to take only cautious steps toward economic reforms , constrained by his tribal power base , which sees such measures as a threat to its political and economic privileges . <p> The palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other perks .

Iran has refused to give up enrichment despite international sanctions and offers of reactor fuel from abroad and for years has stalemated an IAEA probe of suspicions that it worked secretly on developing such arms . <p> The report urged Iran to stop stalling the IAEA probe , declaring that unless it starts to cooperate the IAEA can not " exclude the existence of possible military dimensions to Iran 's nuclear program . " <p> The report also clashed with comments by Israeli officials suggesting that Iran has slowed the timetable for reaching the ability to make nuclear weapons . The discrepancy is important because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before deciding whether to hit Iranian facilities in an attempt to slow Tehran 's perceived efforts to make nuclear weapons . <p> The IAEA report , which was circulated among the IAEA 's 35 board member states , was obtained by The Associated Press . It said between the last IAEA board report in August and now , Iran had put nearly 700 centrifuges that were installed but not ready to operate at Fordo under a vacuum to make sure they are airtight . <p> That is the last step before uranium gas is fed into the centrifuges and the process or enrichment begins -- an activity that can produce both reactor fuel or at high levels the fissile interior of a nuclear weapon . It takes only a few days to start enrichment with machines that are under vacuum . <p> The centrifuges , " having been subjected to vacuum testing , were ready for feeding " with uranium gas , the report said . <p> About 700 other centrifuges have already been producing 20 percent uranium at Fordo since early this year . Another 1,400 or so have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total to about 2,800 in all . <p> While experts agree that the Islamic Republic could assemble enough weapons-grade uranium to arm a nuclear weapon relatively quickly , they point out that this is only one of a series of steps need to create a working weapon . They say that Tehran is believed to be years away from mastering the technology to manufacture a fully operational warhead . <p> Earlier this month , Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Iran has " essentially delayed their arrival at the red line by eight months . " That jibes with the timeframe laid out by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September , when he spoke at the U.N . General Assembly . There , Netanyahu said the world has until next summer at the latest to stop Iran before it can build a nuclear bomb . <p> Iran has a far larger enrichment plant at Natanz , in central Iran , which churns out uranium enriched below 4 percent . But the 20 percent material being produced at Fordo is of greater concern to the international community because it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply and quickly -- and because the facility , near the holy city of Qom , is well protected against attack . <p> Some 140 kilograms -- about 300 pounds -- of weapons-grade uranium is needed for at least one warhead . <p> Olli Heinonen , who headed the IAEA 's Iran probe until 2010 , said Tehran would likely be able to produce enough 20 percent enriched uranium by the summer to be able to make weapons-grade uranium for two or three warheads , if it doubles its Fordo capacity . <p> The report 's other main area of concern focused on Parchin , a military site southeast of Tehran that the agency suspects was used for testing high explosives used to set off a nuclear charge -- and which the IAEA fears is undergoing a major cleanup . <p> Iran has repeatedly turned down IAEA requests to visit the site , which , the report warned " seriously undermined " the IAEA 's ability to conduct effective verification . The report cited satellite photos showing that Iran has torn down buildings , dug up a wide area around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts there . <p> In Washington , State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland would not comment on the IAEA report but said the IAEA been calling on Iran to intensify efforts toward an agreement on its nuclear program for more than a year . <p> According to t he BBC , witnesses reported extensive damage to the building that Egypt 's Prime Minister Hisham Qandil had visited on Friday . <p> Just before dawn Saturday , Gaza City was hit with large explosions , according to the BBC .

In October he said : " During my time as director-general of the BBC , I never heard any allegations or received any complaints about Jimmy Savile . " <p> Yet Friday , the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the London Times over an article it was proposing to write connecting him to the spiking of the Savile story . <p> One former television executive , Stuart Purvis , now a professor of television journalism at London 's City University , said in his blog the controversy could tarnish the reputation of Thompson and his new employer : <p> " The bottom line would appear to be that the man who now runs one of the world 's great newspapers did , earlier this year in his BBC role , put his name to a threat of legal action against one of the world 's other great newspapers after they put to him an allegation about Savile 's behaviour at the BBC that now seems to be accepted as fact . " <p> NBC News contacted Thompson and his spokesman but did not receive a response . <p> But in a statement to Purvis this week , Thompson 's representative said the former BBC chief : <p> " Verbally agreed to the tactic of sending a legal letter to the paper , but was not involved in its drafting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and false allegation put to the BBC that he had influenced the decision to abandon Newsnight 's investigation into Jimmy Savile . " <p> Rob Wilson , a member of Parliament who has followed the case closely , said Thompson 's role in the affair gets stranger and stranger . <p> " I would be concerned if I were in New York . Mr. Thompson also presided over an office that for some reason failed to inform him on several occasions of serious allegations concerning Savile and , by extension , the BBC , " he told NBC News . " Now it appears legal threats were issued using his name against a newspaper over claims that he had n't bothered to read , let alone investigate , but which turned out to be true .

##750851 <p> A new survey found that one in ten smokers lie to their doctors about their smoking habit . Photograph courtesy of Flickr user LawPrieR . <p> The new year always seems like the perfect time to finally kick that cigarette habit . But as any smoker can tell you , it 's easier said than done . In fact , a new national survey found that one in ten smokers lies to his or her health-care provider about the habit , due to the social stigma that surrounds smoking . <p> " The bottom line is that our very audible efforts to deglamorize smoking have had an impact , " says Dr. Cheryl Healton , president and CEO of Legacy , a nonprofit health organization dedicated to helping smokers quit . <p> The survey asked 3,146 current and former smokers whether they disclose their smoking status to their health-care provider ( HCP ) . While a majority of participants said they tell their providers the truth , nearly half of those who did not disclose their status said it was because they were embarrassed . <h> See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper than just shame , says Healton . Tobacco use is strongly associated with those of low socioeconomic status , and patients are usually disclosing to someone of a higher status . " They want to please them and look good in their eyes . It 's a unique doctor-patient relationship . " <p> There 's also the issue of how the health-care providers react when smokers admit their habit . Sixty-six percent of those who did not disclose their smoking said they wanted to avoid a lecture from the HCP . " A lot of people have been subjected to a kind of rant from their doctors , " says Healton , a former smoker . " I actually think the providers are just as responsible , if not more so , for these results . " <p> A Pennsylvania hospital 's recent announcement that it would not hire any smokers will not help the social stigma that prevents smokers from getting professional help , either , says Healton . <p> The crux of the solution , she explains , lies in helping the patient and doctor communicate better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patients need to understand that they can get help from professionals . " <p> Legacy has some tips for health-care providers on how to approach patients who are smokers . In particular , they should understand that the patient has probably tried to quit many times , and should encourage them not to give up . " To me , the success is that the person got his or her act

##753352 <h> When I Retire , I Want To ... <p> " Basically I 'm on my way to Australia . " That was a line delivered by James Garner in the 1969 movie Support your Local Sheriff ! He was handy with a six shooter and basically an entrepreneur , well a drafted entrepreneur . The thing is , like most of us I 'm not sure he ever got where he was going . But he knew where he wanted to go . <p> About seven years ago my wife and I sat on our back porch and decided what we wanted when we retired , or semi-retired because I have some writing I want to do . I was surprised at both her interest in the topic and her choice . You see for about eighteen years I have been looking for a boat . Not just any boat , a 1955 to 1965 fifty-plus foot Chris Craft Constellation or Commander . Well she said , " Why do n't we buy your boat and then live on it ? " I was floored . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living aboard yachts and decided this was for us . So for the last seven years we have been looking for just the right one . Hopefully we are n't too many years away . <p> My goal is not extravagant , but it is a goal . Now we look at opportunities or aspects of the business and always measure it against one particular benchmark . Does it help us move toward the boat ? That 's the question . It has become both a bellwether and common frame of reference for me and my most important partner . <p> I can tell you it 's never too early to define this , and it 's okay if it changes over time . So when people ask me what are your goals , I tell them , " Basically I 'm on my way to the boat .

##756852 <h> The Invisible Borders That Define American Culture <p> When we think about borders , we tend to think of administrative boundaries . Those demarcating lines , often grown out of rivers and mountain ranges or diplomatic quirks , govern our daily lives , and that 's doubly so if we live near a neighboring country or state . <p> We know that these boundaries are on some level unnatural . Driving around Kansas City , where I live , makes this abundantly clear . Gas price differences aside , it can be difficult to tell which state you 're in , Missouri or Kansas , and the small street of State Line Road does nothing to make it clearer . <p> But are there more organic borders , brought to life by our own actions and activities ? I recently set out , along with a team from MIT and AT &T,; to see if I could find an answer . Previously , members of our group had collaborated to use mobile phone call and text message records to determine how tightly connected different counties are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in which we are connected or separated . We can be connected based on where we move , how we speak , and even what sports teams we root for . <p> So our research team , consisting of DeDe Paul of AT &T,; Vincent Blondel of Belgium 's Universit catholique de Louvain , IBM 's Dominik Dahlem * , and myself , set out to understand how a variety of cultural and social properties create borders , and whether or not these borders actually overlap . Are there in fact natural boundaries to the borders that we create as social creatures ? <p> Let 's first examine the different borders we can define . We first have communication , from cell phone data . The map below , based on aggregated phone calls between counties , makes use of an algorithm we developed that detects communities within networks . The result is a visualization of highly connected counties , grouped together by color . These clusters of connected places sometimes coincide with political boundaries , but in many other cases do not . <p> Historically , communication and mobility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people in person . But with the advent of the telephone and the Internet , these two parts of human behavior have become disentangled . So , does mobility affect the borders we find ? <p> Using data from IRS migration records -- where people relocate to -- we constructed a similar map , but this time based on mobility . In this case , we connected and grouped counties based on where people moved , rather than to whom they spoke . Instead of showing the different groupings , we have this time highlighted the borders between these regions . <p> We next combined the two maps , weighting the borders based on how often they are found to occur in both mobility and communication maps . <p> What we found is that , for the most part , there is a great deal of overlap between communication and mobility . This is especially clear in the South , where the border between Mississippi and Arkansas is present for all of the data . In other words , people in Mississippi ( or Arkansas ) primarily interact with others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only within the state . Despite all the technology at our disposal , in many ways we are still products of place . <p> So if there 's still a strong relationship between who we communicate with and the borders of where we live , does that also hold true for the words we use ? <p> One of the clearest regional differences in the U.S. can found by tracking the words people use to refer to soft drinks , which is in fact the map you saw at the top of this story . Pop or soda , or even Coke , these small linguistic differences are not as small as we might think . While " soda " commands the Northeast and West Coast ( green ) and " pop " is in between ( black ) , " Coke " reigns in the south ( turquoise ) . These small distinctions can often act as touchstones for larger cultural differences . <p> We can also look at how different counties voted in the last presidential election ( blue is Democratic and green is Republican , with Purple as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports ! Below is a map of baseball blackout regions , the parts of the country where a team 's games are considered a local market and are subject to certain broadcasting conditions . <p> So , between language , sports , mobility , communication , and even politics , are there any natural borders ? Or does our complex nature make the boundaries that separate us also completely messy ? <p> We combined several maps into one to see if any patterns emerged . At first glance , the result seems incredibly messy , although there are certain borders that do jump out ( such as the Mississippi River , for example ) . But when we zoomed in on smaller regions , it was easier to pick out a few natural borders . <p> For example , New England is incontrovertibly a single region , connected by interaction , mobility , and culture . Similarly , certain states such as Texas and Kansas are their own distinctive regions . <p> On the other hand , New Jersey and California have a distinct bisection that divides them , though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , California is divided into Northern and Southern California , when we look at voice phone calls : <p> But it 's divided into three sections , when we use digital text message records : <p> Similarly , we can do the same thing using sports affiliations to understand where Red Sox Nation ends and Yankees Nation begins . This classic New York Times graphic shows how Connecticut is bisected . <p> While we as humans are incredibly complicated organisms , there are a few simple rules to how we behave . We sort ourselves based on cultural similarities , and these in turn are related to how we choose to move from place to place , and even with whom we communicate . A lot of these boundaries are porous and messy , allowing for a rich diversity of cultural flow . But knowing how we interact as part of a complex society , instead of only looking at political borders , can explain a lot more than we might have imagined . <p> *An earlier version of this story neglected to acknowledge the contributions of Dominik Dahlem to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arbesman is a senior scholar at the Kauffman Foundation and a fellow at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University .

##762651 <p> With the dawn of the Internet , the birth of Internet slang , and the growing age of SMS , many individuals are forgetting the fundamental aspects of English punctuation . Would you like to write a great paper for one of your classes ? Maybe you need to submit a polished , impeccable proposal to your boss . If so , it will help to know proper usage of punctuation . Consider this article a crash course in English punctuation , and read on . <h> Punctuation Cheat Sheet <h> Using Proper Punctuation <p> End your sentences with a period ( full stop ) , question mark , or exclamation point ( exclamation mark or shout mark ) . <p> Use the period ( full stop ) to denote a full stop at the end of a statement . The period ( . ) is one of the most commonly used punctuation marks . <p> The accessibility of the computer has increased tremendously over the past several years . <p> The question mark ( ? ) , used at the end of a sentence , suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done about the growing concern of global warming ? <p> The exclamation point ( exclamation mark , shout mark ) ( ! ) suggests excitement or emphasis in a sentence . <p> I ca n't believe how difficult the exam was ! <p> 2 <p> Use the semicolon and colon properly . <p> The semicolon ( ; ) has a few uses . <p> Use a semicolon to separate two related but independent clauses . Note that , if the two clauses are very wordy or complex , it is better to use a period ( full stop ) instead . <p> People continue to worry about the future ; our failure to conserve resources has put the world at risk . <p> Use a semicolon to separate a complex series of items , especially those that contain commas . <p> I went to the show with Jake , my close friend ; his friend , Jane ; and her best friend , Jenna . <p> The colon ( : ) has multiple uses . <p> Use the colon to introduce a list . Be careful not to use a colon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following suggests the use of a colon . Use only after a full sentence which ends in a noun . <p> The professor has given me three options : to retake the exam , to accept the extra credit assignment , or to fail the class . <p> The hyphen ( - ) was once a common punctuation mark on typewriters , when a long word might have been split between two lines . The hyphen is still used in a number of other areas : <p> Use a hyphen when adding a prefix to some words . The purpose of this hyphen is to make the word easier to read . If you were to leave the hyphen out of a word like re-examine , it would be reexamine , which would be harder to read . Understand that some words do not require a hyphen to separate the prefix from the word , such as restate , pretest , and undo . Let a dictionary be your guide for when to use the hyphen after a prefix . When you use a hyphen , the two words have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cara is his ex-girlfriend . <p> Use hyphens when creating compound words from separate words . <p> The up-to-date newspaper reporters were quick to jump on the latest scandal . <p> Use a hyphen when writing numbers out as words . Separate the two words of any number under one hundred with a hyphen . <p> There are fifty-two playing cards in a deck . ( " The amount is one hundred and eighty " is a common error in the US and Canada , where the " and " is usually omitted . Elsewhere in the English-speaking world , however , the " and " is usually included . ) <p> Be careful with spelling out numbers above one hundred -- if the number is used as an adjective , it is completely hyphenated , since all compound adjectives are hyphenated ( This is the one-hundredth episode . ) . Otherwise , a hyphen should only occur if a number greater than 100 occurs within the larger number , e.g. , He lived to be one hundred twenty-one . <p> The dash ( -- or -- ) should be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden change of thought , an additional comment , or a dramatic qualification . It can also be used to add a parenthetical statement , such as for further clarification , but should still be relevant to the sentence . Otherwise , use parentheses . Keep in mind that the rest of the sentence should still flow naturally . Try to remove the statement within the dash from the sentence ; if the sentence appears disjointed or does not make sense , then you may need to revise . There should be spaces before and after the dash in British English . <p> An introductory clause is a brief phrase that comes -- yes , you guessed it -- at the beginning of a sentence . <p> This is the end of our sentence -- or so we thought . <p> 4 <p> Use the double quotation mark and single quotation mark/apostrophe for different purposes . <p> The double quotation ( " ) encloses a direct quotation , whether made by a person or taken from a piece of literature . <p> " I ca n't wait to see him perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the value of the dollar in developing nations is " strongly influenced by its aesthetic value , rather than its face value . " <p> The single quotation mark or apostrophe ( ' ) has a variety of uses . <p> Use the apostrophe together with the letter s to indicate possession . Be aware of the difference in using an apostrophe with singular or plural nouns . A singular noun will use ' s , whereas the plural version of that singular noun will use s ' . Also , be mindful of nouns that are always considered to be plural , such as children and people -- here , you should use ' s . Be aware of pronouns that are already possessive and do not require apostrophes , such as hers and its ( it 's is used only for the contractions of it is and it has ) . Their is possessive without apostrophe or s , except as a predicate adjective , where it becomes theirs . <p> The hamster ' s water tube needs to be refilled . <p> A singular noun with possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedding needed to be changed . <p> A pluralized singular noun with possession . <p> These children ' s test scores are the highest in the nation . <p> A plural noun with possession . <p> Friends of hers explained it ' s her idea , not theirs , to refill the hamster ' s water tube and change its bedding . <p> Possessive pronouns ( hers , theirs , its ) , contraction of it is , and a singular noun with possession . <p> Use the apostrophe to combine two words to make a contraction . For example , can not becomes ca n't , you are becomes you 're , and they have becomes they 've . Be sure to use correctly possessive pronoun your and contraction you 're -- it is one of the most common mistakes to confuse them ! <p> Use the single quotation mark within a regular quotation to indicate a quotation within a quotation . <p> Ali said , " Anna told me , ' I was n't sure if you wanted to come ! ' " <p> Note that an apostrophe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a singular . This is a very common mistake and should be avoided . <p> CORRECT - apple ? apples <p> INCORRECT - apple ? apple 's <p> 5 <p> Indicate a break or pause within a sentence with the comma ( , ) . This is another commonly used punctuation mark . There are several instances where you might use a comma . <p> Use the comma when denoting an appositive , or a break within a sentence that supplements and adds information to the subject . <p> Bill Gates , CEO of Microsoft , is the developer of the operating system known as Windows . <p> Use the comma when denoting a series . This is a set of three or more " list " items within a sentence . Many writers omit the last comma as " and " is also a connective ( " The basket contained apples , bananas and oranges . " ) . <p> The fruit basket contained apples , bananas , and oranges . <p> The computer store was filled with video games , computer hardware and other electronic paraphernalia . <p> Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing it . This is somewhat similar to a series , except that it is incorrect to place a comma after the final adjective . <p> CORRECT - The powerful , resonating sound caught our attention . <p> INCORRECT - The powerful , resonating , sound caught our attention . <p> Use a comma when referring to a city and state . It is also necessary to use a comma to separate the city and state from the rest of the sentence . <p> I am originally from Ventnor , NJ . <p> Los Angeles , CA , is one of the largest cities in the United States . <p> Use a comma to separate an introductory phrase ( which is usually one or more prepositional phrases ) from the rest of the sentence . An introductory phrase briefly introduces the sentence , but is not part of the sentence 's subject or predicate , and it therefore should be separated from the main clause by a comma . <p> After the show , John and I went out to dinner . <p> On the back of my couch , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Use the comma to separate two independent clauses . Having two independent clauses in a sentence simply means that you can split the sentence into two . If your sentence contains two independent clauses that are separated by a conjunction ( such as and , as , but , for , nor , so , or yet ) , place a comma before the conjunction . <p> Ryan went to the beach yesterday , but he forgot his sunscreen . <p> Water bills usually rise during the summer , as people are thirstier during hot and humid days . <p> Use a comma when making a direct address . When calling one 's attention by name , separate the person 's name and the rest of the statement with a comma . Note that this kind of comma is used rarely in writing , because this is something that we do normally while speaking . <p> Amber , could you come here for a moment ? <p> Use a comma to separate direct quotations . A comma should come after the last word before a quotation that is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an indirect quote . A comma is usually not necessary if you are not quoting an entire statement . <p> While I was at his house , John asked me if I wanted anything to eat . <p> An indirect quotation that does not require a comma . <p> While I was at his house , John asked , " Do you want anything to eat ? " <p> A direct quotation . <p> According to the client , the lawyer was " lazy and incompetent .

For example , some companies use serial commas ( a , b , and c ) and others do not ( a , b and c ) . <p> Many grammar experts believe that parentheses and commas are often interchangeable when setting off information . While this is sometimes true , there are some cases where a set of parentheses might be more suitable , such as in indicating one 's personal thought . <p> Although dashes and parentheses have similar uses , remember that parentheses indicate a stronger " side notion " than dashes . <p> There are exceptions to the hyphen-dash rule . In making compound words , when one of the words is itself composed of two words , use an en dash ( -- ) rather than a hyphen , as in , " He took the Paris -- New York route . " En dashes are also used between numbers , as in page numbers or years , to denote a range . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 -- 62 .

American English leaves the punctuation mark inside the quotation if it is part of the quotation , " like so .

Think about the classic example of a sentence in which the serial comma is needed : " My heroes are my parents , Mother Teresa and the Pope .

##764150 <p> When Cleyardis Yilmaz joined Thousand Trails two years ago and gained access to all of the company 's recreational-vehicle resorts and campgrounds in North America , she did n't know it would change her life . <p> The eighth-grade English teacher visited a campground in Orlando , Fla. , in 2010 , rented a cabin and discovered she enjoyed the vacation so much that she wanted to find a campground closer to her Virginia home in Lakeview , near Petersburg . <p> She not only found Outdoor World Williamsburg , just off Interstate 64 near Colonial Williamsburg , Busch Gardens , Yorktown and Jamestown , but she also found a second home - called a " park model " cottage - that she was able to purchase . <p> The 28-foot-long unit sits smack dab in the middle of the RV resort , close to the indoor and outdoor pool , adult hot tub and pickleball and miniature golf courses . <p> Yilmaz makes the 45-minute-to-an-hour drive every weekend to visit her unit , tend to her plants on the deck and partake in the park 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Yilmaz said recently during one of the hottest days of the summer . " I 'm working on a puzzle right now . " <p> While these units are nothing new to the outdoor-recreation industry , more and more resorts are selling them and offering sites on their properties where people , like Yilmaz , can get away and own a second home without shelling out a lot of money . <p> " In the last few years , with the economy being what it is , it 's become - for Middle America - an affordable second-home option , " said David Gorin , executive director of the Virginia Campground Association . <p> The park models - called that because they can be parked anywhere - also are know as " recreational , transportable homes , " " park trailers , " " cabins " or " cottages . " <p> Legally , park models are recreational vehicles , Gorin said , and always have a place in RV parks . But they mainly stay put . <p> Basically , they are suites of no more than 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorin said . <p> " In many parks , they are there as rental units , " Gorin said . " If you want to go to an RV park , and you do n't own an RV , you have an option of renting a cabin or park model . " <p> Campgrounds - from the small , independently owned ones to the biggest resort chains - are investing in park models , according to Recreational Park Trailer Industry Association 's website , www.rptia.com . Roughly a third of the nation 's privately owned campgrounds now offer their guests such options as rentals , the association said . <p> American Heritage is buying the units for about $75,000 apiece and locating them in the RV park , Rhoads said . Seasonal rent - Memorial Day to Labor Day - will run $3,000 to 4,000 a month depending on the unit , he said . <p> At that price , people get a place to stay not only with electricity , running water and working toilets but also with access to the RV park 's pool , waterslide and game room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a door-to-door motel room , " Rhoads said . <p> Purchase prices depend on where you put the model , whether it 's at a beach-front resort like Myrtle Beach , S.C. , or on more inland properties like Williamsburg , Gorin said . <p> The association said campgrounds , RV parks and resorts in most states will lease sites to park-model owners at annual fees ranging from about $2,000 to $8,000 or more , depending on location . <p> " It 's a good lifestyle for a lot people , " Gorin said . <p> At Outdoor World Williamsburg , resort manager Gary Bock has seen the park models gain in popularity with the buying crowd . <p> Bock , who has managed the property for the past 12 years , said the campground 's owner , Equity LifeStyle Properties , started to sell the resort 's units - ranging in price from $999 to $2,499 - four years ago . Of the 40 units , about a dozen have sold . Owners are required to sign a three-year lease for the site at $2,450 a year , Bock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two basic sizes - 28- or 38-feet long . <p> Throw out preconceived notions that these units look like the cabins of yore - with uncomfortable cots and sparse furnishings , if any . <p> Outdoor World 's models either resemble log cabins or small trailers with vinyl siding . <p> They offer a living room-kitchen combination with a bedroom and a bathroom , or a bedroom , bathroom and loft . Larger models include two bedrooms and two baths . <p> Each has a trailer hitch , said Bock , who lives on the property in a park model . Each also is built on a trailer chassis , with axles mounted to make it a recreational vehicle , according to www.myparkmodels.com . Manufacturers are supposed to build to industry standards that cover everything from plumbing and electrical to size and structure , the site said . <p> But , as Gorin said , these suites at 12 feet wide are bulky and wider than most recreational vehicles , so transporting them every weekend is n't really an option . <p> That 's why many folks - such as Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy them at a resort they intend to visit over and over again . <p> The Hamiltons are pros at camping , starting with tents and moving up to motor homes and finally park models . <p> " We come here whenever we can get here , " said Janet Hamilton . <p> They like being able to use the indoor pool and hot tub in the winter ( Outdoor World opens only on weekends from early December to late March ) , and " we like the people who live here , " Gary Hamilton said . <p> The Hamiltons ' one-bedroom , one-loft cottage sits on the outskirts of the main camp area . Next door is a cottage owned by the couple 's daughter and son-in-law , Jennifer and Elton Whitley , along with their four children . They all bought their park models on the same day four years ago . <p> The Whitleys put hardwood floors in their unit . Janet and Gary have decorated their cottage with rustic relics , like lanterns hanging from the tall ceilings and little signs that read , " Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if no one is watching .

We reelected President Obama and we passed marriage equality initiatives - just to name a few victories . Dan Savage writes about the coalition that worked for marriage equality in Washington State , noting the help that straight supporters contributed to the effort : <p> They gave money , they volunteered their time , they reached out to friends and relatives and coworkers , all in an effort to make it possible for same-sex couples to marry . Gays and lesbians are a tiny percentage of the population . We could n't do this on our own . A majority of the legislators who voted for same-sex marriage ? Straight . The governor who signed the law making same-sex marriage legal in Washington state ? Straight . The majority of the folks manning the phone banks for R-74 ? Straight . The overwhelming majority of people who voted to approve R-74 ? Straight . The president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage equality before his reelection campaign ? Straight . It has gotten better for us -- better , not perfect -- but it has n't gotten better for us in a vacuum . It 's gotten better for us because straight people have gotten better about us . <p> This is n't just a " feel good " column for those of us who support marriage equality . At DailyKos , Markos points out how this is a symptom of a progressive movement that 's maturing . It 's a group of people who realize that if we do n't all stand together , we 'll lose separately . <p> The 2000s have brought a more cohesive progressive movement , led in large part by non-issue specific holistic progressive organizations , like DFA , MoveOn and Daily Kos . This focus on broad movement-building has gotten liberals away from that single-issue mentality to the point where coalition building has become second nature . it was nothing like that even a short decade ago . ... But there is one way the equality movement stands apart from the rest -- it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard Dean ran for president in 2003 , he was considered radioactive because he had passed civil unions in Vermont . Today , just nine years later , we reelected a president who supported marriage rights for all . <p> That dramatic change did n't happen in a vacuum , and it did n't happen passively . And I guarantee that the lessons the equality movement learned over this past decade will pay big future dividends for the rest of the progressive movement . <p> Well heck ... I knew that about coalition building 25 years ago ! I participated in the second march on Washington for GLBT rights . Why ? Because it was A : the right thing to do and B : my GLBT friends were there there at the " March for Women 's Lives " in 1986 . They were also there in 1989 &; 1992 and I joined with them again to march for gay rights in 1993 . We met once more in DC in 2004 to march for choice . Many of us also met in 2006 to urge the US to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large marches in DC , we 've worked together in our communities and state governments to work on issues like domestic violence , adoption rights , marriage equality , choice , religious freedom , and more .

Here 's our on-the-sport report with photos &; video . <p> All of us - in every march , rally , election , etc ... - had various issues that were most important to us personally . But we all realized that what matters most is that we stand united with our friends . <p> Most people are going to get over Obama winning .

##782852 <h> Do You Have a Fragmented Credit Report ? <p> There you are , humming along nicely , when all of a sudden the Finance and Insurance Manager ( aka " The F &I; Guy " ) at a local car dealership tells you he pulled all three of your credit reports from the same credit-reporting agency . <p> Wait a minute : Three credit reports from one agency ? <p> Of course , this makes zero sense and the knee-jerk reaction could be that you 've been a victim of identity theft . Do n't worry , fraud probably is n't the problem . <h> Fragmented Credit Reports <p> If you 've got more than one credit report at any one credit reporting agency , then you have what 's referred to as a fragmented credit report or , more informally , " dupes , duplicate files , frag files , or multiple files . " They all mean the same thing , which is that you 've got a problem . <p> Fragmented credit reports are rare but can happen from time to time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their systems . Instead , they house billions of bits of data that are only compiled into a credit report when a lender ( or another party ) asks for it . <p> When the data bits ( accounts , public records , collections ) are compiled into a credit report , it 's possible they wo n't all end up in the same single report belonging to you . They could end up on different reports , all belonging to you . <p> This happens for of a few different reasons . First , some credit reports do not have infinite size limitations . If your file is too large , the credit bureau can not compile and deliver it , so it breaks it into two smaller and more manageable sizes . <p> Second , if you 've changed your identification enough you could end up with two or more credit files connected by a common identifier , such as a Social Security Number . <p> For example , if you 're Sally Taylor and Sally Taylor-Smith and Sally Ann Taylor and Sally Ann Taylor-Smith , you might end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can combine them but you 've got to know about it before you can ask them to do so . <h> Fragmented Credit Reports are Bad for Your Credit Score <p> The bad news when it comes to multiple credit files is credit scoring . Credit scores are calculated at the file level , not at the consumer level . That means if you have 3 credit files at TransUnion , you 'll have three credit scores at TransUnion . And none of those 3 scores is likely to be accurate because they were calculated based on different data . <p> When credit files split and become fragmented , it 's very likely the information on those files will be different . So , for example , your Amex account may appear on one of your fragments files while your Bank of America account may appear on another . <p> Point being , fragmented files are not carbon copies of each other . <h> How Can You Avoid This Problem ? <p> The file size issue can be addressed , well , by not having too much credit . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a few credit cards and a bunch of mortgages . <p> I 'm talking about someone who has scores of accounts on his or her credit report . It takes a lot to max out your credit file 's size , but I 've definitely seen it happen . <p> The issue of multiple aliases causing duplicate credit files is a little different . If you get married , then divorced , then married again , etc ... you could end up with duplicate credit files simply because you 've changed your name . <p> But , when you change your name did you do so with each and every one of your creditors ? <p> I can see that being easily forgotten , and eventually you could confuse the credit bureaus just enough that they end up with more than one credit report with quasi-accurate identification . <p> John Ulzheimer is the President of Consumer Education at SmartCredit.com , the credit blogger for Mint.com , and a contributor for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling .

##789852 <p> I was no prophet - The order of the words is emphatic . " No prophet I , and no prophet 's son I , for a herdsman I , and dresser of sycamores . " It may be , Amos would meet , for the people 's sake , Amaziah 's taunt . He had a living , simple indeed , yet that of the prophets was as simple . But chiefly he tells them of the unusual character of his mission . He did not belong to the order of the prophets , nor had he been educated in the schools of the prophets , nor had he any human training . He was thinking of nothing less ; he was doing the works of his calling , until " God took him from following the flock , " and gave him his commission . Rup. : " He promises humbly what he had been , what he had been made , not by merits , but by grace , that he had not assumed the prophetic office by hereditary right , nor had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being under the necessity of obeying , he had fulfilled the grace and the command of God who inspired and sent Him . " Twice he repeats , " The Lord took me ; the Lord said unto me ; " inculcating that , what Amaziah forbade , God bade . All was of God . " He " had but obeyed . Jerome : " As then the Apostles , when the Scribes and Pharisees forbade them to teach in the Name of Jesus , answered , ' We must obey God rather than man ' Acts 5:29 , so Amos , when forbidden by the idol-priests to prophesy , not only prophesies , shewing that he feared God bidding , more than their forbidding , but he boldly and freely denounces the punishment of him who endeavored to forbid and hinder the word of God . " Rup. : " heaven thundered and commanded him to prophesy ; the frog croaked in answer out of his marsh , ' prophesy no more . ' " <p> I was no prophet - I am an extraordinary messenger of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this occasion . I have no message to Judah , and therefore need not go there . I have a message to Israel alone , and I must faithfully deliver it . <p> For the account which Amos gives here of himself , see the introduction . <p> Then answered Amos , and said to Amaziah , .... With much freedom , boldness , and intrepidity , and yet with modesty and humility ; not at all moved by his frowns or his flattery : <p> I was no prophet , neither was I a prophet 's son : he was not a prophet originally , or from his youth , as Kimchi ; he was not born and bred one ; neither his father was a prophet , by whom he could get any instructions in the mystery of prophesying ; nor was he a disciple of any of the prophets , or brought up in any of their schools as some were ; he was no prophet till the Lord called him immediately , at once , from his secular employment to this office ; and therefore did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Aben Ezra interpret it , that he was not one of the false prophets that prophesied for hire , and took a reward : <p> but I was an herdsman , and a gatherer of sycamore fruit ; that is , originally : this was the employment he was brought up in from his youth , and was in it when he was called to be a prophet ; he looked after cattle , both great and small ; and at a certain time of the year used , to gather sycamore fruit , which was a kind of figs ; and by , its name had the resemblance both of figs and mulberries . Some take it to be what were called Egyptian figs ; these he gathered , either for the use of his masters , or for food for himself , or for the cattle , or both : or he was an " opener " of them , as the Septuagint ; he cut , them , and made incisions in them ; for , as Pliny ( l ) , Dioscorides ( m ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cut or scratched , either with the nail , or with iron , or it will not ripen ; but , four days after being scratched or cut , will become ripe . Mr. Norden ( o ) , a late traveller in Egypt , has given us a very particular account of this tree and its fruit . <p> " This sycamore ( he says ) is of the height of a beech , and bears its fruit in a manner quite different from other trees ; it has them on the trunk itself , which shoots out little sprigs in form of grape stalks ; at the end of which grow the fruit close to one another , almost like bunches of grapes . The tree is always green , and bears fruit several times in the year , without observing any certain seasons : for I have seen ( says he ) some sycamores that have given fruit two months after others . The fruit has the figure and smell of real figs , but is inferior to them in the taste , having a disgusting sweetness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ochre , shadowed by a flesh colour . In the inside it resembles the common figs , excepting that it has a blackish colouring with yellow spots . This sort of tree is pretty common in Egypt ; the people for the greater part live upon its fruit , and think themselves well regaled when they have a piece of bread , a couple of sycamore figs , and a pitcher filled with water from the Nile . ' ' <p> This account in several things agrees with what Pliny ( p ) and Solinus ( q ) relate of this tree and its fruit ; very likely there might be many of these trees in Judea ; there seem to have been great numbers of them in Solomon 's time , 1 Kings 10:27 ; and perhaps it was one of these that Zacchaeus climbed , in order to see Christ , Luke 19:4 ; for this sort of trees delight in vales and plains , such as were the plains of Jericho ; and in the Talmud ( r ) we read of sycamore trees in Jericho ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be cut down for sacred uses . These also grew in lower Galilee , but not in upper Galilee ; and that they were frequent in the land of Israel appears from the rules the Misnic doctors ( s ) give about the planting , and cutting them down ; and in the opening of these trees , and making incisions in them , and in gathering the fruit of them , Amos might be concerned . Kimchi and Ben Melech say the word signifies to " mix " , and that his business was to mix these together with other fruit . Aben Ezra observes , that in the Arabic language it signifies to dry ; and then his work was , after he had gathered them , to lay them a drying . Some render the word a " searcher " ( t ) of them ; as if his employment was to look out for them , and seek them where they were to be got : however , be this as it will , the prophet suggests that he had been used to a low life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contented , and did not take up this business of prophesying for bread , and could return to his former employment without any regret , to get a maintenance , if so was the will of God . The Targum gives it a different sense , <p> " for I am a master of cattle , and have sycamores in the fields ; ' ' <p> and so Jarchi , Kimchi , and Ben Melech , represent him as suggesting that he was rich , and had no need of bread to be given him , or to prophesy for that . <p> Amos first of all repudiates the insinuation that he practises prophesying as a calling or profession , by which he gets his living . " I am no prophet , " sc . by profession , " and no prophet 's son , " i.e. , not a pupil or member of the prophets ' schools , one who has been trained to prophesy ( on these schools , see the comm. on 1 Samuel 19:24 ) ; but ( according to my proper calling ) a bo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxen ( from ba ? qa ? r ) ; then in a broader sense , a herdsman who tends the sheep ( ? ? ? ) , a shepherd ; and a bo ? le ? s shiqm ? ? m , i.e. , one who plucks sycamores or mulberry-figs , and lives upon them .

The rendering of the lxx ? ? ? ? ? ? ? , Vulg. vellicans , points to the fact that it was a common custom to nip or scratch the mulberry-figs , in order to make them ripen ( see Theophr . Hist. plant . iv . 2 ; Plin . Hist. nat . 13 , 14 ; and Bochart , Hieroz. i. 384 , or p. 406 ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the true meaning of bo ? le ? s . And even if the idea of nipping were implied in the word bo ? le ? s , it would by no means follow that the possession of a mulberry plantation was what was intended , as many commentators have inferred ; for " the words contain an allusion to the ' eating of bread ' referred to in Amos 7:12 , and the fruit is mentioned here as the ordinary food of the shepherds , who lived at the pasture grounds , and to whom bread may have been a rarity " ( Hitzig ) . From this calling , which afforded him a livelihood , the Lord had called him away to prophesy to His people Israel ; so that whoever forbade him to do so , set himself in opposition to the Lord God . <p> 7:14 No prophet - Not originally , or by study , or by any human designation . An herdman - By breeding and occupation I was and still am , an herdman . Sycamore fruit - This fruit was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was no prophet-in answer to Amaziah 's insinuation ( Am 7:12 ) , that he discharged the prophetical office to earn his " bread " ( like Israel 's mercenary prophets ) . So far from being rewarded , Jehovah 's prophets had to expect imprisonment and even death as the result of their prophesying in Samaria or Israel : whereas the prophets of Baal were maintained at the king 's expense ( compare 1Ki 18:19 ) . I was not , says Amos , of the order of prophets , or educated in their schools , and deriving a livelihood from exercising the public functions of a prophet . I am a shepherd ( compare Am 7:15 , " flock " ; the Hebrew for " herdsman " includes the meaning , shepherd , compare Am 1:1 ) in humble position , who did not even think of prophesying among you , until a divine call impelled me to it . <p> prophet 's son-that is , disciple .

They were missionary stations near the chief seats of superstition in Israel , and associations endowed with the Spirit of God ; none were admitted but those to whom the Spirit had been previously imparted . Their spiritual fathers travelled about to visit the training schools , and cared for the members and even their widows ( 2Ki 4:1 , 2 ) . The pupils had their common board in them , and after leaving them still continued members . The offerings which in Judah were given by the pious to the Levites , in Israel went to the schools of the prophets ( 2Ki 4:42 ) . Prophecy ( for example , Elijah and Elisha ) in Israel was more connected with extraordinary events than in Judah , inasmuch as , in the absence of the legal hierarchy of the latter , it needed to have more palpable divine sanction . <p> sycamore-abounding in Palestine . The fruit was like the fig , but inferior ; according to Pliny , a sort of compound , as the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only eaten by the poorest ( compare 1Ki 10:27 ) . <p> gatherer-one occupied with their cultivation Maurer . To cultivate it , an incision was made in the fruit when of a certain size , and on the fourth day afterwards it ripened Pliny , Natural History , 13.7,14 . Grotius from Jerome says , if it be not plucked off and " gathered " ( which favors English Version ) , it is spoiled by gnats . <p> 7:10-17 It is no new thing for the accusers of the brethren , to misrepresent them as enemies to the king and kingdom , as traitors to their prince , and troublers of the land , when they are the best friends to both . Those who make gain their godliness , and are governed by the hopes of wealth and preferment , are ready to think these the most powerful motives with others also . But those who have a warrant from God , like Amos , ought not to fear the face of man . If God , that sent him , had not strengthened him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Lord often chooses the weak and foolish things of the world to confound the wise and mighty . But no fervent prayers , or self-denying labours , can bring proud sinners to bear faithful reproofs and warnings . And all who oppose or despise the Divine word , must expect fatal effects to their souls , unless they repent . <p> 1 Samuel 10:11 When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets , they asked each other , " What is this that has happened to the son of Kish ? Is Saul also among the prophets ? " 1 Kings 20:35 By the word of the LORD one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion , " Strike me with your weapon , " but the man refused . 2 Kings 2:3 The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked , " Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today ? " " Yes , I know , " Elisha replied , " but do not speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked him , " Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today ? " " Yes , I know , " he replied , " but do not speak of it . " 2 Kings 4:38 Elisha returned to Gilgal and there was a famine in that region . While the company of the prophets was meeting with him , he said to his servant , " Put on the large pot and cook some stew for these men . " 2 Chronicles 19:2 Jehu the seer , the son of Hanani , went out to meet him and said to the king , " Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD ? Because of this , the wrath of the LORD is upon you . Amos 1:1 The words of Amos , one of the shepherds of Tekoa--what he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake , when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel . Zechariah 13:5 He will say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farmer ; 
##790251 <p> The dark colors and somber mood in this painting exhibit what had been come to be known as Matisse 's dark period , a time when he was going through personal difficulties . One personal difficulty was that Matisse was not able to find many buyers for his works , which made it hard to provide for his family . His wife had to open a dress shop in order to help provide for the family . These hardships were compounded when Matisse and his wife , Amelie , were found to be scapegoats for a conspiracy involving Amelie 's mother , a housekeeper for the Humbert family . Amelie was forced to close her shop , and Matisse was left to provide for his entire family again . This can partially explain Matisse 
##797950 <p> Average number of years between being sentenced to death and exoneration : 9.8 years <p> Number of cases in which DNA played a substantial factor in establishing innocence : 18 <p> * The list is ordered by the year of the inmate 's release . Occaionally new cases of earlier releases are discovered . Thus , the number assigned to a person above may differ from his or her number in various published DPIC reports . <p> * * DPIC refers to the Innocence Project 's ( Cardozo Law School , NY ) criteria for whether a post-conviction exoneration was the result of DNA testing . <p> The Innocence Project requires that both : <p> a ) DNA testing played a role in the defendant 's reversal , AND <p> b ) the results of the testing were central to the inmate 's defense and to the identity of the perpetrator . <p> Sources : DPIC uses a number of resources when adding cases to the above list , including court opinions , media coverage , and conversations with those directly involved in the cases . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research of Hugo Adam Bedau and Michael L. Radelet . ( See , e.g. , Hugo Bedau and Michael Radelet , " Miscarriages of justice in potentially capital cases , " 40 Stanford Law Review 21 ( 1987 ) ; M. Radelet , H. Bedau , and C. Putnam , In Spite of Innocence , Northeastern University Press ( 1992 ) ; see also M. Radelet et al. , " Prisoners released from death rows since 1970 because of doubts about their guilt , " 13 Thomas M. Cooley Law Review 907 ( 1996 ) ) . <p> Use of the term " exonerated " : Columnist Dan Rodricks of the Baltimore Sun asked DPIC about its list of exonerated individuals . DPIC 's Executive Director Richard Dieter responded , and that response was reprinted in Mr. Rodricks ' column , July 5 , 2009 : <p> With respect to your question about our list of exonerated individuals , we use very strict and objective criteria for inclusion of cases on this list . Basically , the list is determined by the decisions of courts and prosecutor offices , not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of places on our Web site and in our reports , the criteria for inclusion on the list is : <p> Defendants must have been convicted , sentenced to death and subsequently either- a ) their conviction was overturned AND <p> i ) they were acquitted at re-trial or <p> ii ) all charges were dropped <p> b ) they were given an absolute pardon by the governor based on new evidence of innocence . <p> The list includes cases where the release occurred in 1973 or later , which was the time that states resumed sentencing people to death after the U.S. Supreme Court had struck down the death penalty . The list originated from a request from Congress asking us to identify the risks that innocent people might be executed . The original list that we prepared was published as a Staff Report of the House Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights . The list has been favorably referred to by Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court and other federal courts , as well as by many public officials around the country . <p> We believe the term " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this list , which now numbers 133 individuals . Exonerate means to clear , as of an accusation , and seems to come from the Latin " ex " and " onus " meaning to unburden . That is precisely what has occurred in these cases . The defendants were convicted , given a burden of guilt , and then that burden was lifted when they were acquitted at a re-trial or the prosecution dropped all charges after the conviction was reversed . These are not individuals who received a lesser sentence or who remained guilty of a lesser charge related to the same set of circumstances . All guilt was lifted by the same system that had imposed it in the first place . Our justice system is the only objective source for making such a determination . <p> This notion of innocence , that an individual is innocent unless proven guilty , is a bedrock principle of our constitution and our societal protection against abusive state power . One does not lose the status of innocence merely because a prosecutor or other individuals retain a suspicion of guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes no god-like determination of knowing exactly what happened in the original crime . Such perfect knowledge of past events is impossible , either to absolutely prove that a person did or did not do an act . We do not try to make a subjective judgment of what we think happened in the crime . We are merely reporting that in a great many cases the justice system convicted an individual and sentenced them to death , but when the process that arrived at that conclusion was reviewed , the conviction and sentence were thrown out . The individual , who often came close to execution , could not even be convicted of a traffic violation . Surely ,

##1393052 <p> The blue T-Mobile version has been a constant companion for over a month , and in between the Android 4.1 Jelly Bean release on Google 's I/O-issued Galaxy Nexus and other handset reviews , I 've tried to make the GS3 my primary phone . On the whole , it has performed reliably whenever I need it , and I still love the experience of picking up its unabashedly glossy form and using it . ( I 've also come to prefer the blue hue over the white , but am withholding final judgment until I get my greedy hands on AT &T's; red shade . ) <p> Everyone uses phones differently and values different features and functions over others , which is what makes my take on this highly subjective . For instance , in my leisure time , I use phones most for : e-mail , texting over Google Voice , taking photos , making calls ( gasp ! ) , and navigating . I also use it to wake me up , look up reviews and ratings , read the news , tweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and do some banking . <p> I 'm not a huge smartphone e-book reader or gamer ( I prefer tablets for multimedia when I 'm on trips ) , I do n't tend root and re-ROM , I rarely use a Bluetooth headset , and I do n't usually stream or play back podcasts or music unless I 'm on a road trip -- so I did n't really use these features in my everyday life . Since not many other people had the GS3 , I did n't have many opportunities to test out photo-sharing in the wild . <p> The phone comes in blue , white , and red for AT &T.; <p> ( Credit : Sarah Tew/CNET ) <h> What works <p> Here are my picks for the GS3 's best traits . <p> Internet-dependent tasks : So long as I have a strong data or Wi-Fi connection , most of what I do on a smartphone worked like gravy . I rely on a phone for mapping and transportation guidance , and for looking up restaurant ratings . I was able to quickly purchase Amazon products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate via Google Voice . Of course , the data speeds differ by carrier <p> Calling : The phone 's call quality was good enough that I could pick up a phone to call a business , family , or friends , and the onscreen volume boost control usually fixed the problem of a modestly high maximum audio . <p> Camera : I have total confidence that the GS3 's speedy 8-megapixel camera will take a good photo that I 'll be able to upload or share . Photos generally come out crisp and colorful , without many flaws . Sure , there are the shots that other excellent cameras could reproduce a smidge better , but in general , I 'm happy having the GS3 in-hand for my casual photography needs . <h> Related stories <p> Home button : It 's a little narrow for my tastes , but it worked intuitively . I like its triple functionality to go home , pull up recent apps , and launch S Voice . <p> Battery : CNET 's battery drain tests ( we did three ) clocked the talk time at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How long your battery chugs along is entirely dependent on your screen settings and on how heavily you use the device . Some days I used it more moderately than others , but I 'd call it average-to-good in what I expect out of a phone before having to charge it up again . Most heavy users will need to charge once per day . <p> Alarm : Strange as it may sound , I 'm a big fan of Samsung 's smart alarm , which gradually increases the wake-up tone volume over the course of a few minutes . It is n't new to the Galaxy S3 , but it 's nice for those of us who prefer to ease into wakefulness . <p> S Beam : With S Beam , Samsung got a head start on the Android Beam capabilities that Google is bundling into Android 4.1 Jelly Bean . S Beam uses NFC and Wi-Fi direct to share larger format information like photos and videos , in addition to URLs , maps , contact info , and links to the Google Play store . <p> I actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few times in the wild to share URLs . One of those times was to share an article written by my colleague Maggie Reardon , with a Google I/O attendee we met in line there at Google 's annual conference , who also had an NFC-capable Android phone . Fitting , right ? <p> The Galaxy S3 has a terrific 8-megapixel camera . <p> ( Credit : Josh Miller/CNET ) <h> Not so much <p> Big and small , these were my least favorite of the of the Galaxy S3 's characteristics . <p> Reflection : Although I personally like the GS3 's design , it certainly does n't have the premium craftsmanship of some of its rivals . The plastic does n't bother me too much , since it also cuts down the phone 's weight , but the high gloss does sometimes get in the way . The phone screen is extremely reflective , and so is the rest of the body . Sometimes my eyes grew tired of the sheen and of seeing my surroundings reflected back at me . <p> Screen brightness : The screen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling was a problem when trying to read the screen in bright sunlight . You can read more about screen resolution , brightness , and reflection here . <p> Menu button : Outfitted with the TouchWiz interface , the GS3 looks very much like a Samsung smartphone . Sammy did alter TouchWiz to make it look more like Google 's stock Android 4.0 Ince Cream Sandwich , but the GS3 still uses its old menu button rather than Google 's new vision . I 'm ready for a little change . <p> Pop-ups : Samsung stuffs an impressive number of software extras into TouchWiz . On the GS3 , as with other Samsung phones , I often feel choked by the user tips that teach you how to use all the new features . While I 'm all for educating users on tools in theory , I sure got sick of dismissing all those motion control pop-ups . And I do not use over half of the motion controls . <p> Rival phones like the HTC One X ( above ) and iPhone 4S ( below ) have much brighter screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Credit : Josh Miller/CNET ) <p> S Voice : Poor Samsung . Its engineers clearly sweated and strained to complete its S Voice actions app in time to make it onto the Galaxy S3 , but unfortunately , Google 's Voice Actions and Apple 's Siri work much better , especially the redesigned version for Android 4.1 Jelly Bean . After too many bungled attempts , I flat-out stopped searching with my voice . <p> S Memo : I 'm a lifelong list-maker , and S Memo 's more-creative intentions did n't work well for my basic needs . Typing text onto a notepad was no problem , but it was hard to identify several of these nearly identical-looking notes from the app 's overview screen . <p> AccuWeather widget : Of course you can delete the widget or customize the settings , but I 'm of the opinion that your preinstalled weather widget should automatically update the weather multiple times per day . Otherwise , it 's 3 p.m. on a warm summer 's day and you 're wondering why your phone is telling you it 's still 57 degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something ' better ' ? If you 're strongly considering the GS3 , I say yes , go ahead and buy it . I have my minor complaints about the handset , but I still strongly back the Galaxy S3 as one of today 's top smartphones . The top-shelf specs are all there , and the phone performs where it counts . It 'll take you a little time to set up the phone exactly the way you like it , but I do like that Samsung lets you customize the heck out of the Galaxy S3 without rooting it -- from giving you control over the lock screen icons to the ton of motion control settings that you may appreciate more fully than I do . <p> The question of buying now or waiting for other phones is a popular one among CNET readers . My colleague Lynn La and I have looked into this question vis a vis the upcoming iPhone 5 ( incidentally , so has CNET 's Maggie Reardon ) . We 've also been asked if it 's better to buy the Galaxy Nexus with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Android handset . <p> None of us can tell you which phone you 'll personally like best , but I can offer some suggestions . The iPhone 5 will likely have a stronger build quality and a sharper screen . The camera may have cool tricks , but the GS3 's shooter should still remain highly competitive . I prefer summoning Siri over S Voice today , and I expect that to remain the same with Siri for iOS 6 that 's due in fall . <p> Samsung will keep its TouchWiz interface when incorporating Jelly Bean features . There 's also no telling exactly when the GS3 will receive its update and if it will replace S Voice with a version of Google Voice Actions ; Samsung has n't made anything beyond vague references on this one , which is expected since Google has just open-sourced its Jelly Bean code . <p> I will say that I prefer almost every hardware element on the Galaxy S3 over the Galaxy Nexus , whose shining feature is its 4. x OS . It 's still a very good device that will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more basic in most senses . <p> I 've hopefully helped clear up some questions you 've had about life with the Galaxy S3 , or at least my life with the phone 
##1394252 <p> The phrase " animals are people too " has always pissed me off . In this video , I make the case for speciesism . I 'm a speciesist , because I definitely think that humans are smarter , faster and stronger than animals , and the future of everything that animal rights activists and environmentalists love about this planet depends on mankind . We 're not destroying this planet by using its resources ... we 're saving it . <p> I did n't fight to the top of the food chain to eat tofurky . The phrase " vegetarian-grade-meat " is bullshit .

##1395551 people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . " <p> The two parts relating to religion mean the following . <p> 1 . ' Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion ' What this means is that it is unconstitutional to have or promote a national religion . Or a religion that is backed by the government . It does n't mean that religion and government ca n't co-exist , but it does mean no endorsements . To teach any one religion in a public school , regardless of how the people may whine , would constitute an endorsement . Or to force prayer to any god . <p> 2. " or prohibiting the free exercise thereof " What this means is that the government ca n't tell you what to believe , or what not to believe , as far as religion is concerned . Many religious rights activists confuse this idea with that any idea or thought that is contested falls under the same category , but no , just religion . If it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religions can be banned . However it does not mean that you can do whatever you want whenever you want , say that it is part of your religion and have it be ok . Free exercise , basically includes things that do n't affect the ability of others to go about and do as they please . Basic principles of human rights . <p> These two taken together although they do n't forbid church and state interactions , they do make it very difficult for the two to co-exist without it seeming like one or the other is in violation . The current political trend has been to avoid the issue all together with the pure separation of church and state , which eliminates the possibility of either happening . <p> Supreme Court Interpretation <p> The US Supreme Court has developed a three-prong test ( Lemon-Kurtzman test ) it uses to evaluate whether a public activity involves government to the extent of violating the Establishment Clause . <p> Justice William J. Brennan , Jr . summarized the Court 's interpretation of this clause very succinctly in his written opinion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The Establishment Clause forbids the enactment of any law ' respecting an establishment of religion . ' The Court has applied a three-pronged test to determine whether legislation comports with the Establishment Clause . First , the legislature must have adopted the law with a secular purpose .

##1399950 <h> Yes , you can make a difference <p> Those who volunteer learn that it provides multiple payoffs . <p> By Kathleen Connell / November 24 , 2008 <p> The proud smile of a first-grader who suddenly " gets " a math problem ; the beaming face of a shut-in as she receives a long-awaited volunteer visitor ; the opportunity for a disabled veteran to attend a Redskins game , escaping the hard realities of his hospital stay ; and the relief etched on the faces of children as they enjoy a shower and warm meal in a Red Cross facility following a disaster . These are a few examples of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who felt the touch and support of a volunteer this year . <p> As Thanksgiving approaches and families and friends gather for a relaxing celebration , some may feel that the past year -- marked by depreciating portfolios , falling house prices , and perhaps even a job loss -- has left little reason for joy . <p> But rather than focusing on negatives , Americans should consider ways to tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The opportunities are widespread . Many are concentrated in education , healthcare , senior citizen support , and community services such as food banks , nature conservancy , and clean energy . With the excitement of an Obama administration powered by change and fueled by the cry , " Yes we can , " a new volunteerism movement may sweep this country . <p> " Young people entering college this year expressed an off-the-charts interest in serving their community , " says Bob Grimm , director of research and policy development for the Corporation for National and Community Service ( nationalservice.gov ) , an independent federal agency that supports community service groups . <p> People of all generations can add value to their lives and others by volunteering . Boomers , with their skills and experience , are potentially powerful volunteers . <p> " Volunteering as an endpoint is no longer financially viable for many boomers given their economic pressures , " says Stefanie Weiss , vice president of communications for Civic Ventures , a think tank on social purpose in San Francisco . " However , volunteering can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combines personal meaning , social impact , and income . " <p> The opportunity to gain insight into other careers , make valuable contacts , gain experience , or test a new job can provide important payoffs in today 's troubled employment markets . Volunteering may provide skills that could help a volunteer reengineer their career , creating a successful segue to a new job in the nonprofit or government sectors . <p> In a recent AARP survey of Americans age 44 to 79 , the traditional desire to help people in need was cited as a key motivation for volunteer service . More than half of respondents also indicated that proposed awards of $1,000 or more that can be used or transferred to an education savings account for a child or grandchild would also be a powerful motivator to do volunteer work . Offering volunteers access to affordable healthcare would also serve as a major incentive . <p> A lack of time , the need to make money , and limited information on how to volunteer were recited as barriers by those who had yet to participate . A remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if asked , as long as such a commitment was scheduled on a flexible basis . <p> Those willing to serve four to six hours -- a weekend morning or afternoon -- each month , can get started by checking out the following websites : <p> volunteermatch.org -- A matching service that helps people find places to volunteer . More than 61,000 nonprofits have used it to recruit volunteers and employees . <p> idealist.org -- A place to find jobs , volunteer opportunities , internships , resources , and events in the nonprofit sector . <p> civicventures.org -- A site geared to boomers looking to use their experience to address social problems in areas including education , healthcare , the environment , and homelessness .

##1402250 <p> Generally , bad security decisions are made for the same reasons that other bad decisions get made : inability to predict the future , failure to foresee all the consequences of the decision , and a reliance on someone else who does n't live up to their end of the deal . Security is particularly problematic , because we 're often dealing with newer technology , which is not as well-tested , and is consequently less likely to live up to its expectations . <p> As a security practitioner , I do n't know how many times I 've participated in discussions around the potential for system failure when considering the adoption of a new technology . On one side is the security perspective : the new technology is unproven , unpredictable and could result in an expensive failure . On the other side is the proponent 's perspective : the new technology will make things easier , save money and impress customers . <p> As soon as the discussion is framed into those opposing viewpoints , we already know how it 's going to end : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody becomes a CIO on the premise that they will do whatever they can to make things harder , spend more money and annoy customers . The decision-making process is over almost as quickly as the situation is framed . <p> Most of the new services and products that we hear about are designed to " go to market " quickly and offer capabilities and services that are new and unique . Often , that means that their security impact has n't been fully thought-through and that there may be significant flaws in their implementation . <p> Unfortunately , that tends to make " the new shiny thing " more dangerous than what 's tried , familiar and true . Our industry thrives on innovation , but security professionals need to stand up and consistently say , " Slow down . And think about the potential consequences . " Problems arise when the optimistic proponents are unrealistically optimistic about how the new technology will perform . Perhaps it does n't save as much as expected , or is less reliable , or incurs schedule-creep , or is awkward or difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the savings estimates that were initially put forward . Thus , management still thinks it has made a reasonable decision , but in fact has opened the organization to greater risk for a less impressive reward . <p> In the worst-case scenarios , the implementation results in a customer database being penetrated and a website being compromised , leading to a massive clean-up effort , customer breach notifications , share prices dropping and customers taking their business elsewhere ( estimated loss : far more than estimated ROI of the new technology ) . Where it really hurts is when the initial estimated savings never materialize at all , because of the system 's failure . <p> When I speak with other security practitioners about handling these discussions , I describe the initial meeting as a " battle of ideas " -- on one hand , the idea that unreliable systems have a potentially large but unknowable cost and , on the other , the mythical costs savings and world peace that will be achieved when the system is in place . <p> Then , I tell them the truth : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lying because they do n't know if the system will prove to be a failure or not . And the proponent of the system is lying because generally very few things are as good as their marketing literature makes them appear to be . What executives need to understand in order to avoid making bad security decisions is that , often , security practitioners are fairly restrained in their ' lies . ' If someone says " this may cost us millions , " they 're probably being more truthful than someone who says " this will make us millions ! " Always make sure you score the cost of failure as a contingency against the projected savings and it suddenly might make sense to allow safety and reliability

##1406750 <p> LONDON -- It 's one of the most famous names in the world , up there with the Eiffel Tower and Statue of Liberty . But now London 's Big Ben clock tower is to be renamed Elizabeth Tower to mark the queen 's 60th year on the British throne . <p> The announcement on Tuesday followed four days of celebrations earlier this month to mark 86-year-old Queen 's Elizabeth 's Diamond Jubilee . <p> The landmark , part of Britain 's Houses of Parliament , is officially called the Clock Tower but is commonly known as Big Ben , the name of the giant bell in the tower that chimes the famous bongs in the capital . <p> Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed the name change . " The renaming of the Clock Tower to the Elizabeth Tower is a fitting recognition of the Queen 's 60 years of service . This is an exceptional tribute to an exceptional monarch , " he said . <p> Reactions among the public were mixed , however . " Big Ben is so old and iconic , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world people wo n't understand what the Elizabeth Tower is , " said Romanian tourist Mara Ciortescu . <p> Banker Richard Labonte said : " It 's not a bad idea , Ben is a strange name for a tower anyway and the Queen deserves it . " <p> The ornate 315-feet-high neo-Gothic tower features four gilded clockfaces and was completed in 1859 . There are 393 steps to the top of the tower , sited on the bank of the River Thames in the heart of London 's Whitehall government district . <p> The name change was proposed by Conservative Party lawmaker Tobias Ellwood and accepted by parliamentary authorities . <p> " The House of Commons ( parliament ) Commission welcomed the proposal to rename the Clock Tower Elizabeth Tower in recognition of Her Majesty the Queen 's Diamond Jubilee and will arrange for this decision to be implemented in an appropriate manner in due course , " a House of Commons spokesman said . <p> The jubilee celebrations underscored a surge in popularity for the Queen in recent years , and included the biggest flotilla on the Thames for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse-drawn procession through the capital . <p> However , many Britons were opposed to the tower name change .

In the audience at Stockton Memorial Civic Auditorium that night was Eddie Macon , who makes his home in Daly City . Macon , still spry at age 85 , broke the color line as a running back at College of the Pacific and with the Chicago Bears . Seated next to him was Shirley Washington , the widow of former Edison coaching legend , the late Charlie Washington . Across from her was Lawrence Brice , a former outstanding football player at Edison . <p> Van Sweet was there , so was Candace Harper , Pete Turner Jr. , Don Norton , Dave Fisher , Jayne Gibson-McHugh , Pat Doyle , Gary Scott , Bob Amerman , Hank Pericle , Mary Ann Paz and on and on .

He headed back to Nashville , Tenn. , today . <p> The hall of fame banquet , and the visit with Burke and Hawkins confirmed a point all of us need to reflect on from time to time . Yes , Stockton has its problems . But there are a lot of good people who have come through these parts or who have made this community their permanent home . Even those who have moved on to other places still feel a deep connection with this community .

He was raised here . He made friends here like Lynell Hamilton and Chris Henry , his teammates at Edison who also have played in the NFL . Stockton is home to their brothers and sisters , nieces and nephews , and mothers and grandmothers . <p> " I 'm definitely home on the bye , " said Hawkins , 26 , who is under contract with Tennessee through 2015 .

##1413052 <h> Abstract <p> This specification provides an API for representing file objects in web applications , as well as programmatically selecting them and accessing their data . This includes : <p> A FileList interface , which represents an array of individually selected files from the underlying system .

This is a draft document and may be updated , replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time . It is inappropriate to cite this document as other than work in progress . <h> 1 . Introduction <p> This section is informative . <p> Web applications should have the ability to manipulate as wide as possible a range of user input , including files that a user may wish to upload to a remote server or manipulate inside a rich web application . This specification defines the basic representations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to files , and programmatic ways to read files . Additionally , this specification also defines an interface that represents " raw data " which can be asynchronously processed on the main thread of conforming user agents . The interfaces and API defined in this specification can be used with other interfaces and APIs exposed to the web platform . <p> The File interface represents file data typically obtained from the underlying file system , and the Blob interface ( " Binary Large Object " - a name originally introduced to web APIs in Google Gears ) represents immutable raw data . File or Blob reads should happen asynchronously on the main thread , with an optional synchronous API used within threaded web applications . An asynchronous API for reading files prevents blocking and UI " freezing " on a user agent 's main thread . This specification defines an asynchronous API based on an event model to read and access a File or Blob ' s data . A FileReader object provides asynchronous read methods to access that file 's data through event handler attributes and the firing of events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code blocks the ability to monitor the progress of the read ( which is particularly useful for remote drives or mounted drives , where file access performance may vary from local drives ) and error conditions that may arise during reading of a file . An example will be illustrative . <p> Example <p> In the example below , different code blocks handle progress , error , and success conditions . <p> A user agent is considered to be a conforming user agent if it satisfies all of the MUST - , REQUIRED - and SHALL -level criteria in this specification that apply to implementations . This specification uses both the terms " conforming user agent " and " user agent " to refer to this product class . <p> User agents may implement algorithms in this specifications in any way desired , so long as the end result is indistinguishable from the result that would be obtained from the specification 's algorithms . <p> User agents that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specification and terminology . <h> 3 . Dependencies <p> This specification relies on underlying specifications . <p> DOM <p> A conforming user agent must support at least the subset of the functionality defined in DOM4 that this specification relies upon ; in particular , it must support EventTarget . DOM4 <p> When this specification says to terminate an algorithm the user agent must terminate the algorithm after finishing the step it is on . Asynchronous read methods defined in this specification may return before the algorithm in question is terminated , and can be terminated by an abort() call . <p> The term throw in this specification , as it pertains to exceptions , is used as defined in the DOM4 specification DOM4 . <p> The algorithms and steps in this specification use the following mathematical operations : <p> max ( a , b ) returns the maximum of a and b , and is always performed on integers as they are defined in WebIDL WebIDL ; in the case of max(6,4) the result is 6 . This operation is also defined in ECMAScript ECMA-262 . <p> min ( a , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is always performed on integers as they are defined in WebIDL WebIDL ; in the case of min(6,4) the result is 4 . This operation is also defined in ECMAScript ECMA-262 . <p> Mathematical comparisons such as &lt; ( less than ) , ? ( less than or equal to ) and &gt; ( greater than ) are as in ECMAScript ECMA-262 . <h> 5.1 . Attributes <p> must return the number of files in the FileList object . If there are no files , this attribute must return 0 . <h> 5.2 . Methods and Parameters <p> item(index) <p> must return the indexth File object in the FileList . If there is no indexth File object in the FileList , then this method must return null . <p> index must be treated by user agents as value for the position of a File object in the FileList , with 0 representing the first file . Supported property indices WebIDL are the numbers in the range zero to one less than the number of File objects represented by the FileList object . If there are no such File objects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note <p> The HTMLInputElement interface HTML has a readonly attribute of type FileList , which is what is being accessed in the above example . Other interfaces with a readonly attribute of type FileList include the DataTransfer interface HTML . <h> 6 . Line Endings <p> Web applications will need to manipulate data across platforms with different character representations for line endings , also known as newline , line break or end-of-line ( EOL ) markers signifying the end of a line of text . Unix platforms use LF ( e.g. " n " or U+000A in Unicode ) whereas other platforms like Windows use CR+LF ( e.g. " rn " or U+000D followed by U+000A in Unicode ) . An EOL Marker in this specification is either U+000A or U+000D followed by the character U+000A . <p> While particularly useful for DOMString types and text files , a consideration of line endings is also important when creating binary data within the web application that can be consumed by the underlying platform , which could be Unix-based or Windows-based . This interface provides an API to always convert line endings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6.1 . Methods and Parameters <p> Let position be a pointer into input , initially pointing to the start of the string . <p> Let result be the empty string . <p> Let native line ending be be the character U+000A , or the character U+000D followed by the character U+000A , as determined by the underlying platform 's conventions . While position is not past the end of input , run the following sub-steps : <h> 7 . The Blob Interface <p> This interface represents immutable raw data . It provides a method to slice data objects between ranges of bytes into further chunks of raw data . It also provides an attribute representing the size of the chunk of data . The File interface inherits from this interface . <p> The algorithm from WebIDL WebIDL replaces unmatched surrogates in an invalid UTF-16 string with U+FFFD replacement characters . Scenarios exist when the Blob constructor may result in some data loss due to lost or scrambled character sequences . <p> If element is an ArrayBufferView TypedArrays , convert it to a sequence of byteLength bytes from the underlying ArrayBuffer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ append those bytes to bytes . <p> If element is an ArrayBuffer TypedArrays , convert it to a sequence of byteLength bytes , and append those bytes to bytes . <p> If element is a Blob , append the bytes it represents to bytes . The type of the Blob array element is ignored . <p> Return a Blob object consisting of bytes , with its size set to the length of bytes , and its type set to the type member of the options argument , if used . <h> 7.1.1 . Constructor Parameters <p> The Blob() constructor can be invoked with the parameters below : <p> A blobParts sequence <p> which takes any number of the following types of elements , and in any order : <p> type , a DOMString which corresponds to the Blob object 's type attribute . If not the empty string , user agents must treat it as an RFC2616 media-type RFC2616 , and as an opaque string that can be ignored if it is an invalid media-type . This value must be used as the Content-Type header when dereferencing a Blob URI . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snapshot state , which must be initially set to the state of the underlying storage , if any such underlying storage exists . The snapshot state must be preserved through structured clone . If , at the time of processing any read method on the Blob , the state of the underlying storage containing the Blob is not equal to snapshot state , the read must fail with a NotReadableError . <p> Note <p> Snapshot state is a conceptual marker most useful for File objects backed by on-disk resources . <h> 7.3 . Attributes <p> size <p> Returns the size of the Blob object in bytes . On getting , conforming user agents must return the total number of bytes that can be read by a FileReader or FileReaderSync object , or 0 if the Blob has no bytes to be read . If the Blob has been neutered with close called on it , then size must return 0 . <p> type <p> The ASCII-encoded string in lower case representing the media type of the Blob , expressed as an RFC2046 MIME type RFC2046 . On getting , conforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it is known . If conforming user agents can not determine the media type of the Blob , they must return the empty string . A string is a valid MIME type if it matches the media-type token defined in section 3.7 " Media Types " of RFC 2616 RFC2616 . If not the empty string , user agents must treat it as an RFC2616 media-type RFC2616 , and as an opaque string that can be ignored if it is an invalid media-type . This value must be used as the Content-Type header when dereferencing a Blob URI . <h> 7.4 . Methods and Parameters <h> 7.4.1 . The slice method <p> The slice method returns a new Blob object with bytes ranging from the optional start parameter upto but not including the optional end parameter , and with a type attribute that is the value of the optional contentType parameter . It must act as follows : <p> The optional start parameter is a value for the start point of a slice call , and must be treated as a byte-order position , with the zeroth position representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start normalized according to the following : <p> If the optional start parameter is not used as a parameter when making this call , let relativeStart be 0 . <p> This defines the normalization of the start parameter . When processing the slice call , user agents must normalize start to relativeStart . <p> The optional end parameter is a value for the end point of a slice call . The following requirements are normative for this parameter , and user agents must process slice with end normalized according to the following : <p> If the optional end parameter is not used as a parameter when making this call , let relativeEnd be size . <p> If end is negative , let relativeEnd be max ( ( size + end ) , 0 ) <p> Else , let relativeEnd be min ( end , size ) <p> This defines the normalization of the end parameter . When processing the slice call , user agents must normalize end to relativeEnd . <p> The optional contentType parameter is used to set a value identical to one that is set with the HTTP/1.1 Content-Type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following requirements are normative for this parameter , and user agents must process the slice with contentType normalized according to the following : <p> If the contentType parameter is not provided , let relativeContentType be set to the empty string . <p> Else let relativeContentType be set to contentType . User agents must treat it as an RFC2616 media-type RFC2616 , and as an opaque string that can be ignored if it is an invalid media-type . This value must be used as the Content-Type header when dereferencing a Blob URI . <p> This defines the normalization of the contentType parameter . When processing the slice call , user agents must normalize contentType to relativeContentType . <h> 7.4.2 . The close method <p> Calling the close method must permanently neuter the original Blob object . This is an irreversible and non-idempotent operation ; once a Blob has been neutered , it can not be used again ; dereferencing a Blob URI bound to a Blob object on which close has been called results in a 500 Error . A neutered Blob must have a size of 0 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation via any asynchronous read methods . Calling close must not affect any Blob objects created by a slice call on the Blob object on which close has been called . While Blob objects can be neutered via a call to close , they are not Transferable HTML . They are immutable , and thus invalidating them on the sending side is not useful ; implementations can share Blob data between two threads without needing invalidation. <h> 8 . The File Interface <p> This interface describes a single file in a FileList and exposes its name . It inherits from Blob . <h> 8.1 . Attributes <p> name <p> The name of the file ; on getting , this must return the name of the file as a string . There are numerous file name variations on different systems ; this is merely the name of the file , without path information . On getting , if user agents can not make this information available , they must return the empty string . <p> lastModifiedDate <p> The last modified date of the file . On getting , if user agents can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Date HTML object initialized to the last modified date of the file . If the last modification date and time are not known , the attribute must return the current date and time as a Date object . <p> The File interface is available on objects that expose an attribute of type FileList ; these objects are defined in HTML HTML . The File interface , which inherits from Blob , is immutable , and thus represents file data that can be read into memory at the time a read operation is initiated . User agents must process reads on files that no longer exist at the time of read as errors , throwing a NotFoundError exception if using a FileReaderSync on a Web Worker Workers or firing an error event with the error attribute returning a NotFoundError DOMError . <h> 9 . The FileReader Interface <p> This interface provides methods to read File objects or Blob objects into memory , and to access the data from those Files or Blobs using progress events and event handler attributes ; it inherits from EventTarget DOM4 . It is desirable to read data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents . This interface provides such an asynchronous API , and is specified to be used with the global object ( Window HTML ) . <h> 9.4 . FileReader States <p> The FileReader object can be in one of 3 states . The readyState attribute , on getting , must return the current state , which must be one of the following values : <p> EMPTY ( numeric value 0 ) <p> The FileReader object has been constructed , and there are no pending reads . None of the read methods have been called . This is the default state of a newly minted FileReader object , until one of the read methods have been called on it . <p> LOADING ( numeric value 1 ) <p> A File or Blob is being read . One of the read methods is being processed , and no error has occurred during the read . <h> 9.5.2 . The result attribute <p> On getting , the result attribute returns a Blob ' s data as a DOMString , or as an ArrayBuffer TypedArrays , or null , depending on the read method that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may have occurred . It can also return partial Blob data . Partial Blob data is the part of the File or Blob that has been read into memory currently ; when processing the read method readAsText , partial Blob data is a DOMString that is incremented as more bytes are loaded ( a portion of the total ) ProgressEvents , and when processing readAsArrayBuffer partial Blob data is an ArrayBuffer TypedArrays object consisting of the bytes loaded so far ( a portion of the total ) ProgressEvents . The list below is normative for the result attribute and is the conformance criteria for this attribute : <p> On getting , if the readyState is EMPTY ( no read method has been called ) then the result attribute must return null . <p> On getting , if an error in reading the File or Blob has occurred ( using any read method ) , then the result attribute must return null . <p> Partial Blob data must be returned such that where possible , the bytes read thus far should be valid code points within the encoding ; in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , user agents must NOT return the U+FFFD character for bytes that are invalid within an encoding till the entire codepoint has been read . The following encoding caveat must be followed : <p> Suppose a file resource is to be read in UTF-8 , and in hexadecimal the bytes in this file are E3 83 91 E3 83 91 , which is effectively 0x30D1 0x30D1 . Suppose the first 5 bytes have been read . The result returned here must be 0x30D1 and have result.length == 1 , and NOT be 0x30D1 0xFFFD with result.length == 2 . Even though the trailing E3 83 is not a valid code point in UTF-8 at the fifth byte , user agents must NOT return a result with such invalid code points replaced with U+FFFD till it can be determined definitively that the codepoint is invalid . <p> While processing the read , as data from the blob becomes available , user agents should queue tasks to update the result with partial Blob data as an ArrayBuffer TypedArrays object containing the bytes read until the read is complete , to accompany the firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns partial Blob data representing the number of bytes currently loaded ( as a fraction of the total ) ProgressEvents , as an ArrayBuffer TypedArrays object ; user agents must return at least one such ArrayBuffer TypedArrays while processing this read method . The last returned value is at completion of the read . <h> 9.5.7 . Blob Parameters <p> This is a Blob argument and must be a reference to a single File in a FileList or a Blob object not obtained from the file system that is in scope of the global object from which the method call was made . <h> 9.5.8 . Determining Encoding <p> If the encoding argument is present , and is the name or alias of a character set used on the Internet IANACHARSET , let charset be set to the value of the encoding parameter . <p> If charset is null , then for each of the rows in the following table , starting with the first one and going down , if the first bytes of blob match the bytes given in the first column , then let charset be the encoding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row . If there is no match then charset remains null . <p> Bytes in Hexadecimal <p> Description <p> FE FF <p> UTF-16BE BOM <p> FF FE <p> UTF-16LE BOM <p> EF BB BF <p> UTF-8 BOM <p> If charset is null , and the blob argument 's type attribute is present , and its Charset Parameter RFC2046 is the name or alias of a character set used on the Internet IANACHARSET , let charset be set to its Charset Parameter . <p> Example <p> If blob has a type attribute of text/plain ; charset=UTF-8 then charset is UTF-8 . <p> Return the result of decoding the blob using charset ; on getting , the result attribute of the FileReader object returns a string in charset format . The synchronous readAsText method of the FileReaderSync object returns a string in charset format . Replace bytes or sequences of bytes that are not valid according to the charset with a single U+FFFD character Unicode . When processing Partial Blob Data , use the encoding caveat , if applicable . <h> 9.5.9 . Events <p> When this specification says to make progress notifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed : <p> If a given implementation uses buffers of size 65536 bytes to read files , and thus limits reading operations to that size , and a read method is called on a file that is 65537 bytes , then that implementation must fire one progress event for the 65536 first bytes , one progress event for the 65537th byte ( which is at completion of read ) , one load event and one loadend event . <h> 10 . Reading on Threads <p> Web Workers allow for the use of synchronous File or Blob read APIs , since such reads on threads do not block the main thread . This section defines a synchronous API , which can be used within Workers Web Workers . Workers can avail of both the asynchronous API ( the FileReader object ) and the synchronous API ( the FileReaderSync object ) . <h> 10.1 . The FileReaderSync Interface <p> This interface provides methods to synchronously read File or Blob objects into memory . <p> If no error has occurred , read blob into memory . Return the data contents of blob as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions can occur when reading files from the underlying filesystem . The list below of potential error conditions is informative . <p> The File or Blob being accessed may not exist at the time one of the asynchronous read methods or synchronous read methods are called . This may be due to it having been moved or deleted after a reference to it was acquired ( e.g. concurrent modification with another application ) . See NotFoundError <p> A File or Blob may be unreadable . This may be due to permission problems that occur after a reference to a File or Blob has been acquired ( e.g. concurrent lock with another application ) . Additionally , the snapshot state may have changed . See NotReadableError <p> User agents MAY determine that some files are unsafe for use within Web applications . A file may change on disk since the original file selection , thus resulting in an invalid read . Additionally , some file and directory structures may be considered restricted by the underlying filesystem ; attempts to read from them may be considered a security violation . See the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to the data structures of a Web application . An example might be that URL length limitations imposed by user agents on Data URLs may make obtaining large files encoded as Data URLs impossible to return DataURL . See EncodingError <h> 11.1 . Throwing an Exception or Returning an Error <p> This section is normative . Error conditions can arise when reading a file . <p> Synchronous read methods throw exceptions of the type in the table below if there has been an error with reading . <p> The error attribute of the FileReader object must return a DOMError object DOM4 of the most appropriate type from the table below if there has been an error , and otherwise returns null . <p> Type <p> Description <p> NotFoundError <p> If the File or Blob resource could not be found at the time the read was processed , then for asynchronous read methods the error attribute must return a " NotFoundError " DOMError and synchronous read methods must throw a NotFoundError exception . <p> SecurityError <p> If : <p> it is determined that certain files are unsafe for access within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read calls are being made on File or Blob resources <p> it is determined that the file has changed on disk since the user selected it <p> then for asynchronous read methods the error attribute may return a " SecurityError " DOMError and synchronous read methods may throw a SecurityError exception . <p> This is a security error to be used in situations not covered by any other exception type . <p> NotReadableError <p> If the snapshot state of a File or a Blob does not match the state of the underlying storage , then for asynchronous read methods the error attribute must return a " NotReadableError " DOMError and synchronous read methods must throw a NotReadableError exception . If the File or Blob can not be read , typically due due to permission problems that occur after a snapshot state has been established ( e.g. concurrent lock on the underlying storage with another application ) then for asynchronous read methods the error attribute must return a " NotReadableError " DOMError and synchronous read methods must throw a NotReadableError exception . <p> EncodingError <p> If the File or Blob can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to URL length limitations in implementations , then for asynchronous read methods the error attribute must return a " EncodingError " DOMError , and synchronous read methods must throw an EncodingError exception . <h> 12 . A URI for Blob and File reference <p> This section defines a scheme for a URI used to refer to Blob objects ( and File objects ) . <h> 12.1 . Requirements for a New Scheme <p> This specification defines a scheme with URIs of the sort : **40;1237;TOOLONG ... . This section provides some requirements and is an informative discussion . <p> This scheme should be able to be used with web APIs such as XMLHttpRequest XHR2 , and with elements that are designed to be used with HTTP URIs , such as the img element HTML . In general , this scheme should be designed to be used wherever URIs can be used on the web . <p> This scheme should have defined response codes , so that web applications can respond to scenarios where the resource is not found , or raises an error , etc . <p> This scheme should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe access to binary data from web applications . <p> URIs in this scheme should be used as a references to " in-memory " Blobs , and also be re-used elsewhere on the platform to refer to binary resources ( e.g. for video-conferencing WebRTC ) . URIs in this scheme are designed for impermanence , since they will be typically used to access " in memory " resources . <p> Developers should have the ability to revoke URIs in this scheme , so that they no longer refer to Blob objects . This includes scenarios where file references are no longer needed by a program , but also other uses of Blob objects . Consider a scenario where a Blob object can be exported from a drawing program which uses the canvas element and API HTML . A snapshot of the drawing can be created by exporting a Blob . This scheme can be used with the img HTML element to display the snapshot ; if the user deletes the snapshot , any reference to the snapshot in memory via a URI should be invalid , and hence the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Discussion of Existing Schemes <p> This section is an informative discussion of existing schemes that may have been repurposed or reused for the use cases for URIs above , and justification for why a new scheme is considered preferable . These schemes include HTTP RFC2616 , file RFC1630 RFC1738 , and a scheme such as urn:uuid RFC4122 . One broad consideration in determining what scheme to use is providing something with intuitive appeal to web developers . <p> HTTP could be repurposed for the use cases mentioned above ; it already comes with well-defined request-response semantics that are already used by web applications . But Blob resources are typically " in-memory " resident ( e.g. after a file has been read into memory ) , and are thus unlike " traditional " HTTP resources that are dereferenced via DNS . While some user agents automatically " proxy " the underlying file system on the local machine via an HTTP server ( e.g. with URLs of the sort http : //localhost ) , HTTP is not traditionally used with local resources . Moreover , an important use case for these URIs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HTTP URIs have traditionally been used for resources that may be more permanent ( and that are certainly not chiefly memory-resident , such as files that a web application can read ) . Reusing the HTTP scheme might be confusing for web developers owing to well-established practice . <p> The reuse of file URIs would involve changes to file URI use today , such as adding response codes . While they are used inconsistently in web applications , the structure of the URIs would change , and request-response behavior would have to be superimposed on what already works in a more-or-less ad-hoc manner . Modifying this for the use cases cited above is imprudent , given legacy usage . Additionally , the use cases for a Blob URI scheme call for uses beyond the file system . <p> A scheme of the sort urn:uuid RFC4122 could be used , though use of this scheme is unprecedented in HTML and JavaScript web applications . The urn:uuid scheme is very generic . URIs in the scheme urn:uuid have the disadvantage of unfamiliarity and inconsistency across the web platform . A new scheme has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In theory , URIs make no guarantee about what sort of resource is obtained when they are dereferenced ; that is left to content labeling and media type . But in practice , the name of the scheme creates an expectation about both the resource and the protocol of the request-response transaction . Choosing a name that clarifies the primary use case - namely , access to memory-resident Blob resources - is a worthwhile compromise , and favors clarity , familiarity , and consistency across the web platform . <h> 12.3 . Definition of blob URI Scheme <p> This section defines a blob : URI scheme using a formal grammar . A blob : URI consists of the blob : scheme and an opaque string , along with an optional fragment identifier . In this specification an opaque string is a unique string which can be heuristically generated upon demand such that the probability that two are alike is small , and which is hard to guess ( e.g. the Universally Unique IDentifier ( UUID ) as defined in RFC4122 is an opaque string ) . A fragment identifier is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the media type of the Blob or File resource in question RFC2046 . <p> This section uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form ( ABNF ) , defined in RFC5234 . All blob : URLs must follow this ABNF. <h> 12.3.1 . The Opaque String <p> Opaque strings must NOT include any reserved characters from RFC3986 without percent-encoding them . Opaque strings must be globally unique . Such strings should only use characters in the ranges U+002A to U+002B , U+002D to U+002E , U+0030 to U+0039 , U+0041 to U+005A , U+005E to U+007E Unicode , and should be at least 36 characters long . UUID is one potential option available to user agents for use with Blob URIs as opaque strings , and their use is strongly encouraged . UUIDs are defined in RFC4122 . For an ABNF of UUID , see Appendix A . <h> 12.4 . Discussion of Fragment Identifier <p> The fragment 's format , resolution and processing directives depend on the media type RFC2046 of a potentially retrieved representation , even though such a retrieval is only performed if the blob : URI is dereferenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragment identifier could be used to refer to an anchor within the file . If the user agent does not recognize the media type of the resource , OR if a fragment identifer is not meaningful within the resource , it must ignore the fragment identifier . Additionally , user agents must honor additional fragment processing directives given in the relevant media format specifications ; in particular , this includes any modifications to the fragment production given in HTML HTML . The following section is normative for fragment identifers in general , though it should be noted that affiliated specifications may extend this definition . <p> A valid Blob URI reference could look like : **40;1279;TOOLONG ... where " #aboutABBA " might be an HTML fragment identifier referring to an element with an id attribute of " aboutABBA " . <h> 12.7 . Dereferencing Model for Blob URIs <p> User agents must only support requests with GET RFC2616 . If the Blob has a type attribute , or if the Blob has been created with a slice call which uses a contentType argument , responses to dereferencing the Blob URI must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the type attribute or contentType argument . Responses to dereferencing the Blob URI must include the Content-Length header from HTTP RFC2616 with the value of the size attribute . Specifically , responses must only support a subset of responses that are equivalent to the following from HTTP RFC2616 : <h> 12.7.2. 500 Error Condition <p> The request violates the origin requirement . In this case , the response should be accompanied by clarifying text alongside the 500 response , e.g. " 500 Origin Violation . " <p> The request does not satisfy the lifetime requirement . In this case , the response should be accompanied by clarifying text alongside the 500 response , e.g. " 500 Expired URI . " <p> The underlying resource has changed , moved , been deleted or has become invalid . In this case , the response should be accompanied by clarifying text alongside the 500 response , e.g. " 500 Invalid Resource . " <p> The permissions surrounding the underlying resource do not permit access . In this case , the response should be accompanied by clarifying text alongside the 500 response , e.g. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has occurred . In this case , the response should be accompanied by clarifying text alongside the 500 response , e.g. " 500 Security Violation . " <p> This response may be accompanied by additional messages in the response indicating why the Blob resource could not be served . See blob : protocol examples . <p> The 500 Error Condition provides a response code , but not a fixed status . User agents MAY leave it as simply " 500 Error Condition " or supply additional status information ( e.g. " 500 Origin Violation " ) . Implementers are strongly encouraged to provide messages to developers along with the response code . <h> 12.7.3 . Request and Response Headers <p> This section provides sample exchanges between web applications and user agents using the blob : protocol . A request can be triggered using HTML markup of the sort &lt;img src= " **35;1321;TOOLONG ... , after a web application calls URL.createObjectURL on a given blob , which returns **40;1358;TOOLONG ... to dereference that blob . These examples merely illustrate the protocol ; web developers are not likely to interact with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used , will show relevant response headers XHR2 . <p> If there is a file error or any other kind of error associated with the blob , then a user agent can respond with a 500 Error Condition as the response message . This should also be used if any method other than GET is used to make the request . <p> HEADERS <p> 500 Error Condition This file can not be read . <h> 12.7.3.1 . Processing Media Types <p> If a Content-Type header RFC2616 is provided ( e.g. if the blob has an affiliated type attribute ) , then user agents should obtain and process that media type in a manner consistent with the Media Type Sniffing specification MIMESNIFF . <h> 12.8 . Creating and Revoking a Blob URI <p> Blob URIs are created and revoked using methods exposed on the URL object , supported by global objects Window HTML and WorkerGlobalScope Web Workers . Revocation of a Blob URI decouples the Blob URI from the resource it refers to , and if it is dereferenced after it is revoked , user agents must return a 500 response . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ URL API and presents methods for Blob URI creation and revocation . <p> ECMAScript user agents of this specification must ensure that they do not expose a prototype property on the URL interface object unless the user agent also implements the URL URL API specification . In other words , URL.prototype must evaluate to true if the user agent implements the URL URL API specification , and must NOT evaluate to true otherwise . <h> 12.8.1 . Methods and Parameters <p> The createObjectURL static method <p> Returns a unique Blob URI each time it is called on a valid blob argument , which is a non-null Blob in scope of the global object 's URL property from which this static method is called . <p> If this method is called with a Blob argument that is NOT valid , then user agents must return null . <p> If this method is called with a valid Blob argument , user agents must run the following steps : <p> The optional objectURLOptions dictionary argument called options has a boolean member autoRevoke that defaults to true ; if called without using the optional dictionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execute the following sub-steps : <p> Return a unique Blob URI that can be used to dereference the blob argument , and run the rest of this algorithm asynchronously . <p> In the example below , after obtaining a reference to a Blob object ( in this case , a user-selected File from the underlying file system ) , the static method URL.createObjectURL() is called on that Blob object . <p> If the url refers to a Blob that is both valid and in the same origin of the global object 's URL property on which this static method was called , user agents must return a 500 response code when the url is dereferenced . <p> If the url refers to a Blob that is NOT valid OR if the value provided for the url argument is not a Blob URI OR if the url argument refers to a Blob that is NOT in the same origin as the global object 's URL property , this method call does nothing . User agents may display a message on the error console . <p> The example above allows multiple references to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string after both image objects have been loaded . While not restricting number of uses of the Blob URI offers more flexibility , it creates the potential for strings that linger after they are useful , especially in web applications where the document may persist for a while . Developers must explicitly set the autoRevoke dictionary member to false in order to enable this usage . <h> 13 . Security Considerations <p> This section is informative . <p> This specification allows web content to read files from the underlying file system , as well as provides a means for files to be accessed by unique identifiers , and as such is subject to some security considerations . This specification also assumes that the primary user interaction is with the &lt;input type= " file " /&gt; element of HTML forms HTML , and that all files that are being read by FileReader objects have first been selected by the user . Important security considerations include preventing malicious file selection attacks ( selection looping ) , preventing access to system-sensitive files , and guarding against modifications of files on disk after a selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file selection , a user may be bombarded with the file picker associated with &lt;input type= " file " /&gt; ( in a " must choose " loop that forces selection before the file picker is dismissed ) and a user agent may prevent file access to any selections by making the FileList object returned be of size 0 . <p> System-sensitive files ( e.g. files in /usr/bin , password files , and other native operating system executables ) typically should not be exposed to web content , and should not be accessed via Blob URIs . User agents may throw a SecurityError exception for synchronous read methods , or return a SecurityError DOMError for asynchronous reads . <p> Cross-origin requests on Blob URIs occur when a Blob URI is accessed across origins . User agents should ensure that the 500 Error Condition response is used in cross-origin request contexts . <p> Editorial note <p> This section is provisional ; more security data may supplement this in subsequent drafts. <h> 14 . Requirements and Use Cases <p> This section covers what the requirements are for this API , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not satisfy all use cases ; subsequent versions may elect to address these . <p> Once a user has given permission , user agents should provide the ability to read and parse data directly from a local file programmatically . <p> Example : A lyrics viewer . User wants to read song lyrics from songs in his plist file . User browses for plist file . File is opened , read , parsed , and presented to the user as a sortable , actionable list within a web application . User can select songs to fetch lyrics . User uses the " browse for file " dialog . <p> Data should be able to be stored locally so that it is available for later use , which is useful for offline data access for web applications . <p> Example : A Calendar App . User 's company has a calendar . User wants to sync local events to company calendar , marked as " busy " slots ( without leaking personal info ) . User browses for file and selects it . The text/calendar file is parsed in the browser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar view . The user wants to then save the file back to his local calendar file . ( using " Save As " ? ) . The user can also send the integrated calendar file back to the server calendar store asynchronously . <p> User agents should provide the ability to save a local file programmatically given an amount of data and a file name . <p> Example : A Spreadsheet App . User interacts with a form , and generates some input . The form then generates a CSV ( Comma Separated Variables ) output for the user to import into a spreadsheet , and uses " Save ... " . The generated output can also be directly integrated into a web-based spreadsheet , and uploaded asynchronously . <p> User agents should provide a streamlined programmatic ability to send data from a file to a remote server that works more efficiently than form-based uploads today <p> Example : A Video/Photo Upload App . User is able to select large files for upload , which can then be " chunk-transfered " to the server . <p> User agents should provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The user is notified by UI anytime interaction with the file system takes place , giving the user full ability to cancel or abort the transaction . The user is notified of any file selections , and can cancel these . No invocations to these APIs occur silently without user intervention . <h> 15 . Appendix A <p> This section is informative and not normative. <h> 15.1 . An ABNF for UUID <p> The following is an informative ABNF ABNF for UUID , which is a strongly
