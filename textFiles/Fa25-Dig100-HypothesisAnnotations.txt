Yes, it is impressive that these systems can produce text at a rapid speed, but it still falls short of sounding truly human. It lacks real voice and emotion. And if it does not know the answer, it will often just generate nonsense instead of admitting uncertainty. It will be interesting (maybe more concerning) how that changes in a few years though.
I think it's fascinating how these models use math and 3D vector spaces to map the semantic similarities between words. ![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/93033pic1-67207ebc1547f.webp)
Because they don't understand meaning/language semantics, n-gram models can predict typical word sequences but they can't tell whether those sequences make sense in the real world or not.
Sometimes can even respond earlier than just seconds when it comes to talking to ai. 
It‚Äôs impressive how extensive Google‚Äôs reach is in making information accessible. The Library Project shows how digital tools can open up access to rare and diverse texts for a global audience.

Text analysis via n-grams is also good for everyday use such as translation, predictive text, and spell checkers.
I think this is a pretty cool feature in Google's Ngram Viewer! I did this with "America", and almost every term ("of america", "in america", "north america", etc.) peaked around 1943, 1972, and 2013. It's an interesting tool to play with!
This stands for Neuro-Linguistic Programing or Natural Language Processing.
a process of replacing sensitive data with a non-sensitive equivalent, known as a token, to secure data while still allowing its use for critical functions

the segregation of scholarship from curation is how you end up with missing files, messy shelves, and the inability to know where your creations are
the same curiosity and will to survive that allowed our ancestors to evolve and adapt to a world that constantly showed to have no care for its inhabitants, is the same curiosity and drive that drove modern-day people to eventually create the field of digital humanities our evolutionary ancestors left paintings and carvings and sculptures and various other reminders of their existence. some were likely just for fun, the natural instinct of a child to write on a wall, the natural instinct of a teenager to do a little grafitti; but some were from an innate desire to be remembered, to leave a mark on the world, to let the future know you exist, and allow you to live on in memory
before the age of computers, there was a system called the Jacquard Loom that used a punch card system (a binary system) to encode details for knitted/woven fabrics this system is what inspired Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage in their creation of the Analytical Engine proposal, a machine that was supposed to be a digital, mechanical, all-purpose computer making and thinking have always been connected. sexism is the reason why there exists a historical dichotomy between the two.

progress is chaos we cannot have a better future without a revolution, to demand a better living situation from the people in power that have grown complacent on their hoard of gold; or, to simply remove their existence. a better life should not be withheld.
delegating the workload is an important aspect of a functional society that has been forgotten as the USA continued to hone its imperialistic, capitalistic strategies i yearn for the days where if i wanted to buy a chair, i could go to the local chair store down the street, managed by the local chair guy whose family has been creating chairs for generations, whose heart adores the art of chair-making, and can give me personalized recommendations or make a chair that perfectly fits how i sit and how i am shaped instead, i must go to a soulless gray concrete box, whose parking lot kills nature and collects heat and dirt and polluted water, and buy an equally soulless mass-produced chair, assisted by a tired, hungry worker who earns enough money in an hour to buy exactly one small meal, and all they can think about is when they can go home, wishing for a day when they could instead be a painter, a crocheter, a poet; anything but a lifeless worker in a store that kills the community
an economy where everyone is provided with their needs, and where everyone provides whatever they are able to, is the utopian future that i want in this world nobody will care anymore about what shareholders think are best for art (they often ruin video games as an example: they only look at a List of Things that the most successful games have, and then force developers to mash it all into one soulless glob of slop) artists and musicians and writers and game devs can finally focus on honing their craft, expressing (or withholding) what they want to (or do not want to) express, and their patrons can enjoy their work to the fullest farmers will be able to sow and reap freely, without being forced to buy specific seeds from specific companies, without being prohibited from using the seeds of their harvest to perpetually grow as much as they want to, and we will not go hungry again
tangentially related, but this reminds me of a (very noble and beneficial) trend on twitter, where artists and supporters of artists banded together and decided to weaponize Disney's greed in order to take down websites that steal art for profit https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/lawandarts/announcement/view/296
this reminds me of the minecraft server, called *The Uncensored Library*, where the map is built as a vast library in a "neoclassical architectural style" (according to Wikipedia) its whole purpose is to tear down/get past artificial "borders" imposed upon people https://uncensoredlibrary.com/en https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Uncensored_Library_Front.jpg#/media/File:The_Uncensored_Library_Front.jpg
i believe all of these lines must be blurred if the people who have a monopoly (or oligarchy) on resources have the same power over violence, the labels "sinner" and "saint" will be weaponized to bend public perception and behaviors to their will when a poor person starves but the food is locked behind a guarded door, they would desire a change that allows them to regain access to a basic human right. either by returning to our past of community-focused caveman society, or to a future of care and progress where no one lacks basic necessities the examples given for the blurred lines -- i agree with makers are often their own worst critics; coders cannot operate without also cogitating; entertainers must be knowledgeable in the current state of the world (and its history) in order to entertain and connect with the masses
The Manifesto blends academic tone with urgent, activist language, suggesting that how ideas are presented (print, voice, digital) matters as much as the ideas themselves.!![](https://391.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/digital-humanties.jpg)
Traditional academic boundaries are challenged; the manifesto promotes flexible, evolving, interdisciplinary work to match the complexity of digital culture
Curation is framed as active scholarship‚Äîselecting, organizing, and presenting materials becomes part of producing knowledge, not just supporting it.
The ‚Äúsecond wave‚Äù of digital humanities values interpretation and experience, not just search and data analysis, pushing for richer, more human-centered scholarship.
Rather than replacing print, digital humanities reshapes it embedding print within dynamic, multimedia environments that expand how knowledge is share

A sentimental feeling that is usually about a happy feeling.
Old teaching formats can limit the length to which someone can learn.
Old ways of teaching can still be used to succeed today.
This is Great because it talks about social media and the new culture and making you can do with it today !!
I really like how these talks about interdisciplinarity/transdisciplinary/multidisciplinary but want to get in more detail on what they are .
I like how this explains the meaning of Digital Humanities .
I really like this sentence, I don't why, but after reading it so many times it stuck out to me.
- relating to more than one branch of knowledge; interdisciplinary. 
I like how this talked about design and expanding things !!
#NAME?
This was really GOOD because i like how it talked about teamwork !!!!
The image is just appealing to look at for me, again showing the 3 dimensions. -This annotation is for the image not the text . couldn't find the image online.
How I see it is the the bottom line saying "the 2d text that now unfolds in three dimensions." Showing how the 3 dimensions are being displayed here.
Keeping the history of anything is important for the ever ongoing future. Downsizing the importance of the digital world could lead to lots of lost important information for the future. The passage is telling us to forever remember the digital world and the value of it. 
I enjoy how these 2 sentences are phrased how they say flavor in this sentence is fascinating. Using different powerful words to define scholarship in different ways.
Digital Manifesto 1.0 came out in 2002 while digital manifesto 2.0 came out in 2009. I could not find a 3.0 version by the same people but the years seem to match up with pictures included throughout the passage (world of warcraft, wikipedia, and youtube all came out before 2009).

The use of the word medieval here to also use the Medieval esc map with references to the modern day technology (gulf of youtube, Myspace, The Icy North, e.c.) is a really nice touch for this part of the passage because it shows how much the world has changed around tech and the digital world. 
Wikipedia was launched way back in 2001 and is one of if not the biggest sources online to find information about anything ever. Millions of users use is daily and update it by the minute.
Think this could be reference to the people in the world who try to erase information online 
Means embracing of the creative drifts of the world

I like this sentence. Bringing all interests together in once space. 
I love the emphasis on progression of technology and society's lagging acceptance, or interpretations, of said technology. Before this, I hadn't fully appreciated the fact that coming from a text-based society was one of the reasons the early internet was so heavily text-oriented. It makes one wonder how the internet--technology itself even--would have turned out had we been, say, an oratory society.
I think it's worth noting the role entertainment has played in dystopian novels--like *Fahrenheit 451*--as an antagonistic force, or some sort of catalyst for society's intellectual demise. This passage, however, prompts a reassessment of that sentiment and breaks off from the hard-wired connotation that learning must be something stale and arduous. More pain does not always equal more gain.

Perhaps a slightly more accurate mission statement: "To organize **your** information, making it universally accessible and useful **for advertisers**."
All of the humanities require curation as a central feature in their studies. The arts can't go without showing their work, literature cannot work without organization and so on.
Most people think of knowledge as something only academic, but it really is everything you can experience and absorb in the world. All of your senses work together to learn about the world around you, and I think that's so cool.

It's honestly amazing to think how far the digital age has come in such a short time. From wanting to be a "library of the world's information" to becoming the main portal to digital information is aspiring. 
I feel like right now, so many projects are getting copyrighted and it stops people to make anything digital in fear of that barrier
While words have such a huge impact on the world, projects that do the same without any words are more impactful since anyone can derive whatever they want from it. 
This idea of "making" appears constantly throughout the work, for example through the motif of the hands
Ant colony - hard worker/faces reality Ivory tower - secluded from reality
Dichotomy is the contrast of two things that seemingly opposites.
institutional inertia is an organizations resistance to change.
This is true, the digital age has made it a lot easier to do illegal activities, but how can the government manage such activities without infringing on First Amendment rights? This is an interesting description of strength vs. weakness... and here I thought this is what it meant to be strong https://s3.amazonaws.com/pix.iemoji.com/images/emoji/apple/ios-12/256/flexed-biceps.png

Most of these traits listed remind me of AI. After all, it IS basically taking over the internet and digital resources!
I've never heard someone use this term to describe the internet!
Curation lets us tell stories and make arguments in ways that words alone can‚Äôt. Objects and media can speak just as meaningfully as text, often reaching people on a deeper level.
I agree with this because knowledge is not something that is just one thing or one way. There is a whole other realm besides books and lectures. 
" a technique for creating subversive messages by recontextualizing or hijacking pre-existing elements of art, media, or culture to turn them against their original intent, often to critique or dismantle the capitalist system or cultural norms."
I liked how this idea is phrased because scholarship is one of those things many believe to have a fine line. Where even though it might be seen as "wrong" it is done with pride. 
refers to a metaphorical state of intellectual or artistic detachment
I agree with this so much because having accessible API's (application programming interface) allows for additional creativity and exploration opportunities. API's are essentially communicators between different applications. I've run into paywalls many times when trying to find a well-fitting API for a site or prototype.

This sentence is what goes along with the superman comic, essentially saying that the evolution of digitization in humanities doesn't come as an addition, but a fusion and is forever moldable and changeable. I like the little superman comic that goes with it :).
Disciplinary finitude can refer to academic disciplines and is best explained as the (conceptual) limitations within a specific discipline. This term looks at the boundaries placed around disciplines and how that makes way for rigidity with specific methodologies and topics of discussion. This manifesto is declaring that the digital humanities as a discipline challenges this idea. The authors show that the Humanities as a whole offers copious work, the societal boundaries and traditions provided by academia allow for little evolution. I think this largely touches on the need for an ever-changing discipline such as Digital Humanities provides, and why it is so important to humanity.
It is interesting how they knew about this before the rest of us. 
Very true. A lot of people connect through social media
very interesting. I added a picture of a plus sign because this text talks about the expansion and addition that comes with digital humanities https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/thumbnails/000/363/962/small_2x/1_-_1_-_Plus.jpg
I think it is so good how inclusive it is

Vocationalism means an educational philosophy emphasizing that the purpose of education should be to train students for specific jobs 
Topography is an arrangement of the natural and artificial physical features of an area. Digital Humanities is becoming more open ended and global which is starting to attract new people to it. 
How do you research the history of vocal effects? Technology only goes back so far so there's limited information of vocals and the effects it has. ![](https://music.mercer.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2025/06/2024Mercer-OperaThrillsChills_JessicaWhitley980_-X2.jpg)
This is a powerful question! We can look into the history of audio recordings (going back to the late 1800s), but before that there used to be books teaching people how to vocalize--using accent marks and syllable divisions and other kinds of guides to help people with pronunciation. I've seen some of these from the late 1700s, and they might go back earlier. . .

Digital Humanities implies the multi‚Äêpurposing and multiple channeling of humanistic knowledge: no channel excludes the other. Its economy is abundance based, not one based upon scarcity. this stood out to me because it talks about how Digital Humanities is multi-purposing and that it's all about teamwork .
The vision of the digital humanities is that the research, questions, demands, and imaginative work merge so that the humanities are being modified to digital humanities. 
Historians typically have to collect, assemble, sift, structure, and interpret written documents and other historical items. Digital humanities are trying to move towards using technological resources to do all of the physical actions for humans.
The digital humanities are pushing to be able to preserve historical artifacts of every kind through technology. Technology is the best option for preservation since it is always evolving and the best quality, all without taking up physical space.

After learning about Picasso's life in Spanish class, it is interesting to see his name come up on a document about digital humanities which deals with mostly digital works. 
Apparently this term was originated by by Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams in their book to describe the relation between companies and markets so those who produce can create newer or more trendy products which is highlighted through many social media outlets now and days. ![](<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/Wikinomics_front_cover.png"/>)
It's interesting how the author didn't denote Wikipedia like the majority of people and more so teachers do by saying it's more like a university of knowledge rather than something to be ashamed to research and source off of and add to so that society has freer and more accessible access to all sorts of information which can be changed if not currently accurate.

It refers to having a large scale or large amounts of an object or idea. Copia comes from the latin word abundance meaning plenty.
I find it interesting and creative how the publisher decided to place in visual keys instead of words allowing for the reader to interpret the meaning of them giving us an inside into the DH space.

I thought this was interesting because there is an image of a sofa that turns into a bunk bed this factor makes this product or copy much more valuable and better than its original. I think this is also explaining that a person might change themselves or their thought process based on information they see in some media and hold more value in their new personality.

I love this image sequence specifically because of where it comes from: techniques that are unconventional to grab attention and spread a message. In a more sinister way, guerrilla warfare is when small troops use unconventional tactics (like ambush) to disrupt the larger conventional enemy. It also stuck out to me because of something called guerrilla testing. It is a user testing method for prototypes that is inexpensive and gets you automatic feedback (kind of in an "ambushy" way).![](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/64/31/3d/64313d6cc9474cf4c6fb8b2bd4fefc6b.jpg)

using water jets to teach about electronic circuits is actually a really genius move -- i remember a couple physics instructors liken electrical current to water current. it's why, in circuit boards, circuit lines will only bend at a 45-degree angle, because a 90-degree bend will restrict the flow of the electrical current. similar to how water flows through a straw

This reminds me of how Microsoft (allegedly) once said that Windows 10 would be the "last operating system", which was already a downgrade from the freedom of Windows 7. Only to then force users to leave Windows 10 by ending support, and the only remaining Windows option is Windows 11, which takes away a lot of user freedom, introduces random AI assistants that no one wanted (and that spies on everyone). A lot of people decided to switch to Linux due to this.

I think it's rather narrow to sum up the digital wallet and Charlie as "a chatbot that helps you pick sneakers." What is the product nowadays? What is it that companies harvest and hoard? It's data! Therefore, if we lock up our data then we gain some of that power that diffused throughout the internet over the last few decades. While we certainly will need stronger measures, the data wallet could be an essential tool in this fight if only it had the right kind of force behind it.
I think this is the perfect solution. As mentioned above, people want their privacy, but are also not willing to give up the convenience provided by giving it away (at least most people aren't). This user-owned method perfectly combines the two, and I can only hope that a privacy-first approach like this can spread as quickly as the internet once did.
The GDPR is a sizeable privacy and security law that was passed in May 25, 2018. Since then it has had a substantial impact on the personal data landscape by making accountable any organization that collects and tracks data of, or related to, people in the EU. Though we quite obviously do **not** live in the EU, the presence of this law enforces companies to adapt their practices, and we often receive certain benefits of such changes as a result.

That doesn't sound good, I get that your personal data has to go into storage/ multiple storage places but I think for how little ai is developed it shouldn't be used to store any sort of non-public points of personal data such as social sec, birth certificate info, or anything else along those lines.

great show
This comparison to the UN shows just how global and impactful Tim's achievements were for the World Wide Web. It needed to be recognized by everyone!
I didn't know they were accomplishing this much in the field of particle physics back in the 80s! I wonder how much more they've progressed since then, giving the huge upgrade in technology and knowledge nowaways?

I think it's interesting how they compared his behavior to that of a computer buffering. After all, he did spend over 30 years advancing the Internet!
I'll have to take note of this. I never really thought about it until now, but he's totally right. The web is about that vast and open sea where you can share and receive, but nowadays we get loaded up and shipped off to islands where they convince us that we can't swim or build or do anything but labor for our oppressors' greed. We do not even own our convictions on islands such as these.
What a stark contrast to the previous sentence...
It is interesting how he started at such a basic job but was able to create such a useful piece of technology in the digital world.
Formidable means inspiring fear through being impressively powerful or intense.
I like how Berners-Lee was modest and chose to not patten it because he knew it would be helpful to everyone.
This shows that even though Berners-Lee created such an important coding format, he is just like everyone with his own hobbies and interests.

It's very interesting how the web‚Äôs growth was driven by companies working together on shared standards and choosing collaboration over legal conflict.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes 
I would have never guessed that the internet's development depended so much on selflessness. Collaboration? Yes. So many people had to set aside personal gain in order to support a shared vision. 
It's funny how quickly technology has advanced, from the simple beginnings of the early web to the complex systems we rely on today.

**The principle of least power** suggests one uses the least powerful language suitable for a given task. If these various industries were to drag HTML along with them as they developed more and more advanced languages/technologies, then HTML would not have retained the universally applicable form factor that we have the benefit of enjoying currently. 
"Balkanization" is the splitting up of larger areas, regions, territories, etc into smaller--usually more hostile--independent states. It is usually used pejoratively, and in this context he uses it to describe the possible future of the web if it cannot be collaborated on with amity.
Project Guttenberg was established in 1971 by [Michael Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart), the creator of the eBook, whose mission statements‚Äìper Project Guttenberg‚Äìwere to: "Encourage the Creation and Distribution of eBooks," "Help Break Down the Bars of Ignorance and Illiteracy," and "Give As Many eBooks to As Many People As Possible." Interestingly enough, Project Guttenberg began with Michael single-handedly typing out important pieces of work such as the *Declaration of Independence*, Shakespeare, Mark Twain, and much more. By 1987 Michael had digitized 313 books this way before, fortunately, finding others willing to assist him with this project‚Äìthus allowing the Project Guttenberg to further flourish. ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Michael_Hart_at_HOPE_Conference_%28cropped%29.jpg)
We've used Project Gutenberg a lot as a foundation for digital humanities courses / coding projects, and I never realized that Hart had hand-prepared hundreds of those gorgeously coded texts! 
The web took selfless sacrifices to be developed. Companies giving up patent rights would cause them to loose money, which is why i dont think anything like the "web" or bigger will be developed nowaday.
It depends, though, on whether altruism and public services still matter to tech developers. I think it's a blinking question mark and consortium-based developments are are possible, surviving, and continuing on...but it takes informed communities to maintain and develop them.

From the ashes of those companies that were bought out or shut down will come those that rise up and take over the market when the power of these companies become too rampid. This leads to competition, determination, success, and failure of those who will prevail and go-on and those who will shutdown/ sell-out.
From what I found this is a European company or project that introduced TCP and IP for its intranet which eventually lead to the World-wide-web at that same place.
That makes sense why and how he began to learn not only coding and how to develop the very very vast world at the time. This goes to show how much power the influence of people have over the destiny of outcomes for someones future.

Well, hackathons can really be for any reason: not just for AI or internet startup companies. A hackathon is just a group of people getting together to write a lot of code for a while. I guess when they go to Tim Berners-Lee's house in Concord, Massachusetts, it's a "pond-ithon" b/c they're computing near the pond. 
![](<img src="https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/Tim-Berners-Lee-640-1.jpg" alt="Affilated Faculty - Tim Berners-Lee"/> )
Ever since the web was created, there have been constant changes, realizations, and studies that show how much more we have to learn and discover.
Everyone around the world used the web for their own use. Even political leaders drove their campaigns using the web to reach the most amount of people at one time.![](https://p7.hiclipart.com/preview/333/748/15/communication-social-media-art-capital.jpg)
Anyone has the capability to put anything on the internet, which is beneficial but could also cause problems for society.
To make the web, companies and people had to give up rights, as well as time and energy.
Berners-Lee is admired for his humble nature. He invented the web, probably the most used system in our society, yet refused to patent it.

I just find it fascinating that Berners-Lee had started the foundation for all of these web languages. If it wasn't for him I don't where web would be at today.
The world's first web page address provided information about the World Wide Web project. Pretty empty but that is what you should expect from it.

I didn't know exactly what this was, but shortly found out it: was instrumental in popularizing the World Wide Web and the general Internet during the 1990s by integrating multimedia such as text and graphics. Although not the first web browser, it was the first browser to display images inline with text instead of a separate window.
I love seeing passion in people, so it's cool to see that coding wasn't the only thing Berners-Lee did with his life. 
There are a lot of issues with the internet right now, I think it will take a lot of work and time to fix everything. 
This metaphor is used to show how impossible this tasked looked. 
I think there is still a lack of compassion on the internet, but I don't think any design will fix it, I think it has to do with culture.

This was a personal data store prototype that was built on a Raspberry Pi and it allowed users to control their own data by storing it locally. 
I love that this was a commercial use of the little raspberry pi that hobbyists play with! it's too bad it didn't get fully developed. :-/ Some context: https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/securely-tailor-your-tv-viewing-with-bbc-box-and-raspberry-pi/ 
According to Google, Tim Berners-Lee moved to Concord, Massachusetts. He occasionally worked as a professor at MIT. He grew up in London, UK and attended Oxford University for his education. 
This is a Chinese microblogging and social media platform in September of 2025 it was reported that they have 261 million users.
I think I problem with aggressively going after misinformation is what determines if the source is not fact. Who determines whether something should be take down if they believe it is wrong. I think misinformation is natural in online spaces. 
W3C is an international, public-interest, non-profit, organization that develops open web standards and guidelines. 
I also learned about this organization in COMM 270 with Mr. Kang. The World Wide Web Consortium or W3C develops standards for the web, like HTML, CSS. They help the web become more accessible for all. Here is their logo below. ![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSuM-cLZogd4CfBMg2mrfLkW9dW_wZasBeKMQ&s)
This is a nice HTML joke. Hypertext is any text that contains links to other texts. 
I remember Lee's name popping up in my COMM 270 class as well. That is where I learned the foundations of HTML. I hope this class further improves my abilities in this style of website coding. 
Mary Lee Woods was on the programming team for the first computer to be sold commercially in 1915: the Ferranti Mark 1. ![](https://www.ferut.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FERUT-Console-2.jpg)
Dr. B here! TEST ANNOTATION! (Hi Digit 100!) :-)
licensing issues between the two
good at optimizing multiple inputs 
Code that is available to everyone 
I wonder if the other operating systems that lived around as long as Git were also as revolutionary as it was?
Anyone, even me, can access this software's code for free
The "Linux kernel" is the core component of a Linux based operating system.
The improvements are very impressive. How does Git balance simplicity in design with the complexity of its features?

A revision control system.
Hard to turn this Chromebook into its own machine!
In Git, branches are incredibly lightweight‚Äîthey‚Äôre just pointers to commits! That‚Äôs why you can create, switch, and delete branches almost instantly, making it easy to experiment with new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
The Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system, acting as the bridge between software applications and the computer‚Äôs hardware. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a free and open-source alternative to proprietary Unix systems
Distributed Version Control System
I respect the dedication this team had in order to not only keep this going but also improve it even more in the process.
Linux is associated with chrome and its like the engine of a car 
whole a year after i was born lol !!! and I'm learning it 21 year s later 
A big controversy is already stated in this but the general idea is that there was a licensing conflict between the Linux developer and BitKeeper. 
a now-discontinued, initially proprietary, distributed version control system (VCS) developed by BitMover Inc.That was famously used for the Linux kernel before a licensing dispute led Linus Torvalds to create Git.
The kernel was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and was soon adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system which was created to be a free replacement for Unix.
BitKeeper breaking down led to the evolvement of Git. Git was able to be created and updated because creators learned from the issues with BitKeeper.
I never knew Git started this early on. It seemed like a relatively new thing to me. Maybe because I am mixing it up with Github. 
Good point: Git predates GitHub, and there are several different implementations of git for sharing projects over networks. So you'll see systems like BitBucket, GitLab, Codeberg...GitHub is the one most people are using and it has very strong support for digital project development, but...people are a little tetchy about it lately b/c Microsoft bought GitHub a few years ago and people are worrying about AI engines scraping their code... We shall talk more about this! 
good for group projects.
this will help for me becuase I have a hp windows laptop.
I've never used this, but it doesn't seem efficient
Was this model more taxing than the previous centralized model at the time of its development? Or was the impact on storage, download/upload times, etc pretty much negligible in comparison?
The ability to track, revert, and compare changes makes a VCS a powerful safety net that can benefit many. I think this is a very beneficial tool. 
This defiantly helps with having different computer systems like mine. Most people in college have Macs, but their are some, like me, that use windows and this helps so much to share files with others. 
I have unfortunately dealt with this first hand on Word for IPad; there's virtually no saving besides local VCS even if it's a shared document. 
Organized data in a tree like format.
This is good for multiple people to work remotely. 
It's good to know that if make a mistake I can change an individual problem in the website. 
Always make sure your in the right file by using pwd.
It is important to back things up regularly.
version control is important when collaborating with others and to rollback changes. 
standard for 20 years 
RCS was one of the earliest version control systems, developed in the early 1980s for Unix. It stores changes as deltas, meaning it saves only the differences between file versions, which made it efficient for tracking revisions in individual text files like source code.
Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing multiple users to collaborate, manage revisions, and restore previous versions efficiently.
Git was created in 2005 after a conflict with BitKeeper (a discontinued software tool for distributed revision control of computer source code) and is know for its speed and simple design for non-linear development.
How did people collaborate before CVCSs?
I remember what it was like! (And I still collaborate this way on a lot of projects.) We would use Dropbox or Google Drive with automatic file syncing...and it would be a mess to figure out when different people were editing the same file, as they'd generate multiple copies of it automatically in a shared folder... like file.doc and file (1).doc...it could be really messy on a web project!
Will there be a future project where we collaborate with multiple people in the class using these systems since this is a feature?
i will keep this in mind for when i get my design job!!! fo web design 
i like this page because it a lot of visual diagrams and stuff!!
i like the diagram this really helpful!!
I think this diagram is an excellent explanation of how a repo can work and what it does I think this is very helpful when being introduced to the Digit 110 repo 
In other words, if one were to work on a Microsoft word document and Microsoft word online shuts down for an hour you will lose access to that document for an hour. 
Yep. worth emphasizing. 
The RCS (Revision Control System) is an older, simpler version control system that predates Git. 
This will be very different from how I usually work with files. I tend to copy and move files without caring where they are located unless I am working with Adobe Premiere Pro where files have to stay in their original directories. 
VCS, or version control system, is a tool that tracks changes in source code files. Git is the most famous one as it's the most flexible and powerful one, and the others mentioned (CVS, Subversion, Perforce) are older and more niche VCSs
Nowadays checksums have become more of a standard practice, but Git's use of checksums is one of the reasons it stood out in the earlier days.
Was this a big must-have when developing git--local operations for speedy interactions? Or did this locally-based approach come about as a result of other development goals/attempts?
This is very nice and convenient. It makes working on something go faster.
Since they are similar, If i learn how to operate one, I could probably operate the other ones. 
Why would you stage a file instead of committing it?
Its nice to have a reliable system that you can access from anywhere with little problems.
This is one of the reasons Git is very streamlined and beginner friendly.
This system is one of the most efficiant ways to represent long binary numbers.
How does Git's data model improve or complicate conflict resolution during merges?
I actually learned this with Doctor B, if you save you files to one drive it could mess up the code when putting it into GitHub.
This is really cool and I didn't even consider this as a way to store version history.
VPN stands for virtual private network, and it encrypts you data and masks your Ip address. 
Important stages of git
Makes it easy so fix mistakes for new people.
It makes working on a project much quicker.
store data as a set of files and index of individual file changes over time and is used by git, Subversion, CVS, Mercurial, and other systems. 
Goes in depth on the many ways to undo something with git and gives plenty of examples 
This 40-character hexadecimal string acts like a fingerprint‚Äîif even one character in a file changes, the SHA-1 hash changes completely, helping Git detect tampering or corruption instantly.
A VPN is a secure connection that encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a remote server, hiding your IP address and protecting your data from hackers, trackers, and surveillance. It‚Äôs commonly used for privacy, accessing restricted content, and safely connecting to public Wi-Fi networks.
Git was originally created by Linus Torvalds in just two weeks in 2005‚Äînot to build an operating system, but to manage the development of one: the Linux kernel! He designed it to be fast, distributed, and secure, and it quickly became the gold standard for version control.
Does committed mean the same as saving? 
A small-sized block of data derived from another block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage
Virtual Private Network. 
This coupled with the diagram really helps to see how the Git add, commit, and push really work and how the data gets staged then pushed 
It is important to recognize the differences between Git's user interface and the user interface of other tools that you have used before so not to get confused.
Familiar with autosave features, Snapshots of a project allow for you to go back to previous versions. This helps against corruption and other problems. 
The command line is the text-only interface where you can type in commands to interact with your operating system
Yes, I agree, once you get to know Git commands, it becomes second nature to you.
Command Prompt on Windows: press the Windows key + R, type cmd in the Run dialog box, and press Enter. Administrator privileges: type cmd and press Ctrl + Shift + Enter. Can also click the Start button (Windows icon), search for cmd, right-click the result, and select Run as administrator.

Allows you to interact with Linux operating system.
Command line is the only place you can use all commands. That's why we are using it. 
One great instance to use a GUI for Git is when resolving merge conflicts
While your choice of graphical Git client is personal, some offer helpful features like visual diffs and easy branch management.
i definitely open up in terminal because it easier for me!!!
Instead of manually going into your folder on your laptop or desktop you can open Git Bash/Git command line and you can navigate through your folders this way and move documents around. The time I used this I found it difficult but after spending some time with it and looking up some videos i was able to get it! 
GUI= graphical user interface. This describes when users interact with computer applications through visual symbols.
these steps are very helpful !!!!
Warsame's comments here reflect how technology is not only recording but also preserving.this establishes how memory isn‚Äôt just internal or biological, but externalized in technological systems ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-forums-api/attachment/thread-3707902-15699498985419792476.png)
This statement is powerful because of its powerful emotion. Warsame himself as if hes being devoured, and his feelings of vulnerability. 
This contrasts the rest of the topics covered in this passage. Its ricin imagery, and depiction. kind of showing what the human eyes can see, and a computer cannot.
This statement is really powerfull causes it ties into the theme that humans are always leaving behind traces. In this case he uses a physical example, such as a skin. Which plays into the google timeline motif

Perhaps good writing fools us into thinking we had a choice in the first place.
In relation to scurvy this is a powerful and violent why to describe how dangerous it can be.
I know this poem and it is very meaningful and powerful, but how it make you think about what he is saying pretty cool.
This stands out to me because i do painting and photograph a bit, and feel as though I can relate to this.
Happened to me too.
is a needed protein in the body. really helps bone structure. make sure you get enough vitamin C daily
I really like this passage here. He says that he has changed, which he has, but it unsure almost as if he is hesitating.
This kind of stuff has happened to me before

I don't think there should be any record of this. What is the reason for it?
Very deep part of the passage here and I very much relate to it. So many days I regret saying something or regret doing something and it all hits me while I'm laying in bed trying to get to the next day. Every night messes every day up and Every day patches the night up. 
Crazy thing to drop onto the reader after just learning about his friend Izzy but it helps us understand what the writers thoughts were like and how he picks and chooses certain parts to remember and others to lose forever. 
I really like this line because he had to laugh because if he didn't he wouldn't know what to do. While the other boy was having fun he couldn't enjoy it because he was being quite literally out powered.
I really like this line because of the good being found in something that could be taken as dangerous.

The pain and fear of things stick with you. ![](https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1673002094039-3b4a9e8d1fff?fm=jpg&q=60&w=3000&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MXx8ZGFyayUyMHdhdGVyfGVufDB8fDB8fHww) I have always had a fear of dark ocean waters ever since I watched shark week as a little kid. 
I do this too.
This happens to me too. I relive past injuries when i feel a similar pain.
This is very creepy to me. It should be illegal.
This affects me sometimes too, where i make the past seem better than it was
I feel I ought to try introducing this into my day-to-day, but I don't think I'd be surprised if I were to find it just as universally applicable. 
Nostalgia has such a strong effect, because often times people live in the past too much instead of enjoying the present.
This is kind of how like when you look into a mirror, you don't look exactly like you do in the mirror as other people see you. The only way to get a full perspective on yourself is from other people.
How can something be un-soothing and rhythmic at the same time.
I've always found it interesting how some of my hair could be floating around different parts of the world.

I like that they make a point to say many things you look deep into are not very interesting or are only interesting to a certain point.
Makes a point about all of the war over this time period and how most of it led to minimal gain or nothing.![](https://medievalists.gumlet.io/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Battle_najera_froissart-e1502556755372.jpg?format=webp&compress=true&quality=80&w=768&dpr=1.5)
Every person has their own memories and people do not remember the same things. Often forgetting things that others will remember forever.
I read a book with very similar discussions called *The Body Keeps the Score* by Bessel van der Kolk and found myself in a similar position. Sometimes passages in this book were so striking that I remember them and the experience around it (reading about trauma and the body whilst on the treadmill at my local gym). I highly recommend that book, by the way. ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FYdD-7hzL._SL1500_.jpg)
This is a great written expression of how the past can be experienced, and points to its fragility. It also shows the urgency and demand of the here and now, leaving little time to reflect on the ghost of the past or the hopes of the future. 
The narrator's companion says about the puritan "...he is the most deadly of them all..." implying that to bathe in front of any of them would be, to some extent, unwise. While each passerby encounters the sea as they may, this soul deems it all unfit or unworthy for her. Thus, she and her body depart the sea *entirely* in search of the "Greater Sea". Perhaps the duo delude themselves with this Greater Sea, perhaps it is out there, but I don't think it would be wise to look to this soul for advice if you want to have anything to do with the sea.
This is wild because yes we shed around a pound and a half of skin every year, but by 70 we shed about 100 pounds of skin.
I find this true to myself and my daily life as well. It's almost disrespectful or ironic when I get suggestions through my phone. What I mean by this is that technology seems to know the habit, but not the humanity, emotions, and experiences that lead to that moment. A good example of this is google maps recommending to drive to a job you just quit or a school you just graduated from. Something about the utter irony of "you're right, but..." puts the data collection back into perspective for a minute, and I savor those moments. 
The poem itself is called "[The Greater Sea](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55373/the-greater-sea)"
This is a very raw take on the human experience. One of my current favorite things that I have been taught in psychology is that memories we tend to think about fade and change more because our recollection of that memory is us remembering the last time we thought of it. This is why sometimes things we haven't thought about in a while (or since it happened) are so vivid in our minds when we recall them, as if they had just happened. 
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Louise_Rosenblatt.jpg) Louise Rosenblatt's reader-response theory began with her interest in students' unique reading interpretations while teaching English Literature at Barnard college. Something interesting to note about the theory itself: she never wished to push forward reading focused on isolated or individual readers. She was more so interested in how readers negotiate meaning in social settings as a means of furthering human development.
American writer and civil rights activist
This reminds me of a specific part of my childhood, but also of accounts from others (specifically women) in which supposedly harmless interactions evoke a sort of powerlessness that--from that point on--glows indelibly in the skylight of the mind.
very interesting metaphor 
A good example for this is with horror novels like the work of Stephen King Most of the horrors in his books are never described in vivid detail, therefore letting your brain fill in the gaps of what it is really like. This leads to every interpretation of the story being personalized to your fears.

Newcastle is a large city is Australia with beautiful beaches. Sydney is another city a few hours away from Newcastle. ![](https://assets.atdw-online.com.au/images/733b955d045b5515d22b92b7a2312a62.jpeg?rect=306%2C0%2C4884%2C3663&w=2048&h=1536&rot=360&q=eyJ0eXBlIjoibGlzdGluZyIsImxpc3RpbmdJZCI6IjU2YjIzZjhhZDVmMTU2NTA0NWQ4NGM0YSIsImRpc3RyaWJ1dG9ySWQiOiI1Yzc4YjE5YWJlNDkwMzQ4N2Y2ZmZlYTAiLCJhcGlrZXlJZCI6IjVjNzhiMTlhYmU0OTAzNDg3ZjZmZmVhMSJ9) (Image of Newcastle)

This line shows how forgetting can be a form of self-protection, but also a tool of power. If one person can intentionally blur memory to avoid pain, then a nation could do the same on a massive scale, but to what extent does this become unhealthy and cause more harm? 
![](<a href="https://www.vecteezy.com/photo/41321849-molting-snake-skin-on-a-rock">molting-snake-skin-on-a-rock Stock photos by Vecteezy</a>) All I could think about were reptiles shedding their skins.
This idea is also best described with the phrase "Complacency is the enemy of creativity" because if you get complacent in life you stop growing as a person and eventually sink into a mundane routine and lose your enjoyment of life.
There have been many studies that were conducted showing how time does seem to move slower from your perspective when you are bored/staring at a clock because your brain is starting to go into a less efficient state.
In Apple's privacy policy they admit to having a copy of everything you do using your phone. Furthermore if you had accepted the privacy policy even if you requested they delete your data they can refuse and keep the data anyway.
It‚Äôs both fascinating and unsettling to think that our bodies leave behind traces we can‚Äôt see and don‚Äôt control. The idea that someone could tell we were in a room days later feels almost invasive, almost a reminder that presence is more permanent than we think. 
Memory is shaped more by perception than fact. The funny thing about time is that we don‚Äôt just remember what happened, we remember what we were willing or ready to feel, which often reshapes moments to fit how we want to see them. Experience becomes a kind of personal storytelling. 
This quote speaks to a key lesson I learned involving the creative writing process. Raw emotion alone isn‚Äôt enough. To write meaningfully, one must learn to sit with emotion, not be consumed by it in order to channel it with intention rather than chaos. It‚Äôs the balance between feeling deeply and crafting deliberately. 
def: drawn out or too long
This is insanely interesting. Just like the law of conservation of mass, matter is neither created nor destroyed, nothing really dies. 
This made me realize how much I rely on the internet. All the apps and websites I check every day have been so grained into my routine that it's not even a second thought. ![](https://localist-images.azureedge.net/photos/31439334065144/original/8c2bbd6f1b8dfdd9996b540102640e8ae4e182e0.jpg)
A lot of memories have wrong timelines due to how we perceive them. Thats why two people can have different stories while telling the same exact memory.

Collagen is a structural protein in the human body.
I think this does a great way of showing that even if you have healed or gotten over something bad it still lingers.
This is an interesting and eye opening thought. I had never thought of a cliche as a form of manipulation.
This part was interesting as Ive always taken Vitamin C supplements, but never understood what it did for my body.
This makes me think of the Ship of Theseus. If every part of the ship is replaced, is it still the same ship?
This reminds me of the quote by Hunter. S. Thompson, "Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming "Wow! What a Ride!‚Äù.

I like to think that every time we rebuild ourselves we shed bad experiences and can make new, better ones. 
Ewwww. No I do not want to. Another way to think about this is if you have ever lost someone they are still with you in a kind of gross way.

I am not sure if I have ever thought of my body as just a container of organs and skin. It is an interesting take on the difference between mind and body. 
I watched a video recently on uncontacted tribes and portions of aboriginal tribes popped up. Some were moved because of military testing in the vast desert where they live. 
Although not much is stated about Khalid Warsame's father, we do know he was of Somali origin. In Khalid's journal *Overland* it mentions how Khalid's interest in literature came from him. 
Cuttagee is a city in New South Wales, Australia. It rests in the bottom right of Australia home to popular cities like Sydney and Newcastle. 
This is a very interesting metaphor relating dead fallen skin to servers of a network. 
The image to the left is actually a section from a famous painting made by Salvador Dali. I remember learning about its meaning in Spanish class. It is called the "The Persistence of Memory" and was painted in 1931. This is the full painting ![](https://i.insider.com/57334575dd0895f9788b4786?width=1000&format=jpeg&auto=webp)
The author uses the image of a man with his back turned to the sea as a way to show that people will often turn their back on the whole and just focus on a small fragment so they don't have to deal with more than they can handle.
The author talks about how it is basically a choice to remember memories or past experiences and that it's offensive to purposely forget about something that happened or someone.
I thought this was an interesting statement because time is probably literally the most stable thing- it is always there and every day is the same amount of time. However, in the context of memories from the past, the author talks about how he can "feel the ghost of it", like he knows it was there but everything keeps moving forward.![](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9meMCxtJU3NWkh5YcPs7qG.jpg)
This sentence stuck out to me as it metaphorically compares the skin we shed to being able to "rebuild" ourselves. I think this is insight to how the author feels about his life- he wishes he could rebuild it.
This caught my eye. Whenever we were kids, we could always imagine that we would look astonishing in a sci-fi movie or look like a super hero. This sentence perfectly describes how we can see ourselves in our future or in a completely new world.
Scurvy is a disease caused by a severe deficiency of vitamin C. 
I found this sentence interesting and relatable. Everyday life can sometimes make you feel like you are just going through the same motions, or habits, like the author mentions before. This sentence also refers to technology knowing and tracking our every move, and how that can make us feel trapped in space as well.
This book written by James Baldwin explores racial injustice in the United States. 
Im not showing an image as it is pretty graphic. This is an image of an orcish-like being eating a naked human body. Look it up if you what but this is just here to describe what it looks like.
This idea of being a small child compared to the father resonates with the theme throughout this article of Warsame compared to bigger things (time, generations, humanity, the "vast conspiracy of memory").
 He was an American writer and civil rights activist who got his claims out by using essays, novels, poems, and plays.![](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQOLLmwKIQiZFGEosv3rhdgunaFx9vU6rjkZhuwlpHKqlayYR3tYcRds_WIra54mVprbn5V5DfUYHMZltWIgsLeaszGlLmo7uPnR2SIjMja8w) 
was a Lebanese-American writer, poet and visual artist; he was also considered a philosopher, although he himself rejected the title. 
He saw how relient people are on their parents when they are children and how children feel powerless to make their own decisions.
There was estimated to be 65,000 aboriginal sites relating to the indigenous peoples of Australia or their languages, but now there is estimated to be 100,000 sites.
He is referring to where private entities own the means of production and capital, investing for profit in a free market economy driven by supply and demand and competition.
I think it's fascinating how genetics works like this, outside factors/events can trigger changes in the future generations. That goes along with his point earlier that "Nothing really dies, and wounds don't heal"; your memories and self will just shed on to the next generation.
That's the thing about time and events as time trudges on we learn, build, and the powerful cover up the events which are useless to their goals meaning the site which once was something special is now a new type of special thing that will write its own history and have it be destroyed in a matter of a few hundred years as a result of time advancing forward.
She won a National Humanities medal in 2012 as well as many other awards for her literature and other accomplishments.
I don't agree, I believe silence is a very powerful tool that promotes the feeling of being nice to a person and through honesty and truth comes kindness where a person lays out either true facts or feelings for another allowing for them to either be saddened or improve as a result.
This isn't only true for the body but for the mind as well, however pain isn't always the worst thing since through pain we can discover a better version of ourselves and improve as a result.
This paragraph is interesting because it desplays the majority of places we as a society not just as an individual have gone helping promote a minority of business that produces and sells the majority of supply allowing for large companies to acquire that info and destroy their competition as a result. ![](https://i0.wp.com/www.neilkingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/atomic-habits.png?fit=600%2C343&ssl=1)

I can relate to this, because especially during high school it felt like time just kept going too fast, and I couldn't slow down and reflect on memories/what happened in the past. Luckily, during the relaxing, hot summer days (like he mentions later on), I feel much more energized and cherish my memories.
David Maisel's photobook is meant to depict landscapes as sharing similarities to the human body. He uses mines, urbanization, water zones, etc. to highlight environmental scars in his photos, but it can also look like scars on human skin. ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KPuG2BY0L._UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg)
He felt shame over this memory because to him it proved that he was weak in body and in character but he was looking at this from the perspective of a child. This makes think about how in my own life I misunderstood a lot of things because I was only a child trying to figure out the world around me and it created a lot of core memories. 
This shows how dependent people have become on technology... he literally proceeds to give the most detailed and memorable account of his time at the beach, but says it was almost like he wasn't even there. Do his memories not mean as much when they aren't being tracked somewhere?
I think this painting brought him back to the moment when an older kid picked him up and he was helpless against the older boy and that's why he felt so frightened and overwhelmed by this painting. 
This stood out to me because it not only comments on the biological process of humans shedding, but it also refers to how there is a little bit of us everywhere metaphorically. Like in the trips he mentioned previously, in the memories and people he knew, there is a little bit of him in the little things.
I think it's interesting that the author finds bodies frightening but is also fascinated by them because of his experience seeing Francisco Goya's painting on Saturn Devouring His Son at such a young

in my opinion this is the most relatable text from this essay , because we all do sub consciously , but he brought it to light which made me actually think 
It‚Äôs not just relevance ,it‚Äôs resonance. Writing turns life into a kind of echo chamber where everything you‚Äôve felt, feared, or longed for bounces back with new clarity. Even pain gets repurposed, not erased but reimagined.
I think this saddening due to the fact of him remembering every punishment he had and that causing him to find an aversion to conflicts and that this is what sticks out to him from childhood. He doesn't talk about things that made him happy or other things that were memorable and exciting aspects in his early life. 
i took this how your thoughts could prohibits ur actions depending on your past 
this gives a ridiculous perspective of how much we shed 
After getting a tattoo this gives me more closure about why it looks faded
I found this interesting because even if you get hurt in some way your mind might forget the experience but your body will always remember 
Nasa used it for solar systems because it allowed an increase in image capacity

The Archimedes Palimpsest Team is managed by Michael B. Toth and they are a bunch of multidisciplinary scientists from 1999 - 2011 who read and discuss the Archimedes Palimpsest manuscript. 
I wonder how many popular documents, articles, artifacts, etc are out there that have, hidden with them, texts unexplored by spectral imaging.
I don't know whether to laugh or cry...
This is a thirteenth century prayer book that contains erased texts including, The Method and Stomachion, which are two treatises can not be found nowhere else.

Each slice of this cube represents a narrow band of wavelength, and once stacked with the rest of the monochromatic slices, you are left with this shape called a data cube that exhibits a useful spectral dimension running parallel to the "face" of the stack.
The example of the Dead Sea Scrolls shows the bridging of science and humanities. It is fascinating to understand the method‚Äôs ability to recover lost texts.
This distinction clarifies the two spectral imaging methods, emphasizing that multispectral imaging is a more focused approach. It shows how tailored technology can be effectively applied to preserve and analyze historical documents without unnecessary complexity.
This is a copy of the address that was for Lincoln's secretary John Nicolay. This is thought to be the earliest surviving copy of the address we have.
This has revealed that Thomas Jefferson, while writing the Declaration of Independence, had made some interesting errors. Such as writing "our fellow subjects" which was later corrected to "our fellow citizens" to break away from implying the rule of a monarchy.
I think it's really interesting how spectral imaging can be used to uncover even super ancient documents! It just shows how far we've come with digital and scientific developments and it's impressive!
This reminds me of my astronomy class last year, how spectral analysis is used to identify stars and elements.
Another popular text that was somewhat recovered with spectral imaging was the "Gospel of Mark" which was written in a Greek Old Testament. 
From what I learned in chemistry class the infrared spectrum goes from weakest being radio waves to strongest being gamma rays. 
pretty close! That's the electromagnetic spectrum, and infrared is a wavelength just slower than visible red ...and ultraviolet is at the other end as the waves move with higher frequency! 
From what I learned in chemistry class the infrared spectrum goes from weakest being radio waves to strongest being gamma rays. 
This map is genuinely fascinating, it has a lot of interesting components to look at, like the blowing of the directional winds, the perspective of the world map, and what was considered america at the time. ![](https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/discovery-and-exploration/images/ct000725Z.jpg)

I would have never thought that there was math involved in spectral imaging.
Very cool to see how ultraviolet and infrared lighting affects images. 
The colors as a result of spectral processing are really cool to see. 
Spectral imaging can also be used to find land mines by analyzing surface emissivity changes, and tracking coral bleaching in the environment, they also enable applications like finding oil fields.
NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland was called upon to assist in monitoring harmful algal blooms in 2014. Glenn conducted aerial surveys twice a week during August and September using their hyperspectral imaging sensor aboard the S3 Viking aircraft.
Wow, great context on this reference in the text! I had no idea that research happened to so close to us here in Erie!
Spectral imaging can even detect ink differences that are invisible to the naked eye, helping researchers distinguish between original writing and later edits. This makes it especially useful for studying historical documents and uncovering hidden layers of meaning.
Multispectral imaging is a way of taking pictures using light beyond what our eyes can see, like infrared or ultraviolet. It‚Äôs super useful for things like finding hidden writing in old books or spotting changes in plants from space.
It's interesting to see how not only Livingstones works are being spectrally imagized but also many other works which date much further back than his writings which with any luck can go onto one singular page like Livingstones works.
Hyperspectral imaging means to provide the smallest of the small parts to make a continuous spectrum for each pixel where multispectral imaging captures data across a much larger boarder.
They record electromagnetic radiation at specific, distinct wavelength bands across the manuscripts written by the famous explorers.
cameras can range from 12,000 dollars to 50,000(according to google)
13th century prayer book.re discovering erased texts. 
We will start to uncover much more history as this technology develops
I think it is so cool how the environment around him affected the pages of his diary
The Digital Humanities awards where they got basically second place to a website called Peripleo. Which is A search prototype by Pelagios Commons. 
an English professor at Oregon State University and the University of Maryland, who is also the associate director of the livingstone online site. 
I was so caught up in using spectral imaging to preserve text and knowledge in these diaries that--until now--I had somewhat overlooked the possible breadth of knowledge these pages hold in material *alone*.
It is crazy how such important information was stored on a bunch of scattered pieces of paper.
It's impressive how technology can recover details invisible to the naked eye, opening up new possibilities for historical research and preservation.
after the death of the originator
These 2 projects used similar technology to decipher the palimpsest (text that has been erased and then written over) that was from decades to centuries before what was currently written.
It's crazy to think that the manuscripts have survived that long that they are still legible with the use of technology.
The advancements in history over the years through technology is ground breaking.
The Victorian era was a very popular time for people to travel especially with the expansion of the British Empire.
I imagine this took a very long time to process and decipher considering it was written on many old scraps of paper and the ink was faded!
"Vicissitude" means an unexpected/difficult change in circumstances, which makes sense here as Livingstone went through different environments, climates, tribes, and people with his manuscripts.
Not only has the spectral imaging process help recover many of Livingstone's journal entries, but has made way for and piloted new techniques to perform spectral imaging. This is a huge call back to "yesterday's information tomorrow" as items of the past (both Livingstone's journaling and past spectral image processing techniques) are being used to inform tomorrow's decisions and create something brand new. 
In September 1978 the Center for Editions for American Authors ceased to be a grant-making body funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, and so they became the MLA Committee on Scholarly Editions. The MLA Committee on Scholarly Editions or CSE advises editors on editorial principles and grants a seal of approval to editions it has inspected and found to fulfill its standards.
I would love to learn more about these other projects, and they impacted technology.
I want to learn more about topography lowkey .
this project really paved the way for technology back then !!!
I feel like during that time this was the greatest technology ever invented. 
love the links to the manuscripts. 
like how he focused on one topic to write about bet e had a lot to write about
I want to get a better understanding of the project itself .
Not going to lie I can't read it with my naked eye lol!!
This thirteenth century prayer book contains erased texts. These erased texts include two treatises by Archimedes that are The Method and Stomachion.
The image below this paragraph emphasizes how light can change you perspective and make an image more visible. 
It amazes me that these manuscripts lasted long enough to be able to be preserved since many scraps of paper were written on.
Advanced spectral imaging technology is used to digitalize the diary and manuscripts from David Livingston's 1870 field journal. Previously, some parts of this work was unable to be deciphered due to lack of technology.
This was a 2015-2020 research effort that used advanced imaging techniques to recover the erased, ninth-century Syriac text of Galen's major pharmacological work
Horace Waller was a clergyman, writer, and antislavery activist, he was known for his work in Africa. During his time in Africa he worked with Sir John Kirk and David Livingstone, and became an anti-slavery activist. He's known to have collected botanical and entomological specimens.

Livingstone's manuscripts focused primarily on his field diaries, journals, and letters.His observations included detailed observations about slave trade and local cultures.
def: small shrub with vibrant red seeds. can be used for medical purposes like heartburn and chest pain. 
def:grants high quality humanities projects to cultural institutions
This must have been horrible to experience. 
These new innovations have brought people together from all over the world, which is awesome.
This section of text is letting the reader know what the detailed section is by. 
Letting the reader know when the documents arrived in Britain, which was in 1870s.
Wouldn't this raise concerns about historical accuracy and bias? I think it goes on to show how narratives can be shaped or distorted by those with specific agendas or sympathies and we could never know. 
This moment shows Livingstone‚Äôs impressive innovation and resourcefulness, where rather than letting his work stop, he adapted to his environment and used natural materials to create ink. The scientific curiosity and determination to continue documenting is inspiring. 
I wonder what happened to the original copies of his work if they were only given transcriptions of the work.
I find it interesting that this technology was made for the Department of Defense but is now applicable for history documentation.
It is crazy how big the world is that some people have never seen people of a different race.
What was he trying to find in his travels and why did he go here?
This kind of serves as a parallel between modern humanities and Livingstone's time: just as how Livingstone utilizes unusual, different methods of communicating his ideas, digital humanities strays away from the traditional medium of print to convey to a larger audience.
His determination to keep documenting the things around is very admirable.
I wonder if the impossibility of deciphering can partially come from his mental state deteriorating, or if its primarily because of what it is written on and how?
I think what happened with the spectral imaging work is a discovery of a lot more legible text than people were aware of at first! 
![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91AiZyNnlBL._UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg) this plant is also known as the "Lipstick Tree" and is used to make cosmetics, natural dye, and as a spice!
I wonder how many people saw the documentary and started researching about his story and writings.
I forget that animals that weren't native were barely seen by others back then. It really makes me appreciate how far we've made it.
It's amazing how he used anything he could find. I can't imagine wanting to write something so much that I would grab anything available. 
Nyangwe is a town on the right bank of the Lualaba River, east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
I cannot even imagine how awful something like this must've been. When I looked this up, it came up as potentially Buruli ulcer (*Mycobacterium ulcerans infection*). This can cause long term disability and the bacterium that is on the skin produces a toxin, which is what causes the damage. If it was on his feet, it must have been painful to even walk. [](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/buruli-ulcer-(mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection))
This documentary is available to watch on PBSs website and on amazon prime.
Well, at least the opening teaser‚Ä¶ the full episode hasn't been available to watch in a while! (I'm trying to get hold of a copy over interlibrary loan.) 
Its unfortunate that despite the effort, some of his recordings are lost.
This section does a good job highlighting the determination he had in his recordings.
I think it's interesting how resources from an organization focused on studying astronomy and geology could be used to advance knowledge in humanities and history!
These writings could go towards a psychology research project. 
It's important for these documents to be kept safe because Livingstone's writings could possibly help research projects on animals 
Again, it's impressive that technology can do things that people never thought would be possible- like deciphering historical documents.
It's amazing that technology has evolved to the point where it can decipher handwriting that is nearly impossible to read with the naked eye. It shows how valuable technology is.
He worked with what he had very resourceful!!!
As i look through the website i really like how there are many different sections you can go to. To learn about Livingstone and his Life .
I think the links on this paper are very helpful for visual learners like myself .
LOVE HOW ALL JOUNRAL WRITING ARE ACCESSIBLE THINKS THAT COOL VERY DETAILED WEBSITE
like how there are links to things so the viewer can get the full effect of Livingstone projects.
Feel like this is great information on where Livingstone traveled.
I really like how they made a website as a museum so viewer can get a better understanding of the history of living stone!!! 
Livingstone witnessed hundreds of Africans being slaughter by Arab slavers at the Nyangwe market on the banks of the Lualaba.
This shows how valuable and risky preserving his work was during that time.
a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America, cultivated worldwide for its seeds but i have never know about this thing 
Zanzibar's slave trade was a thriving market in the 18th and 19th centuries Zanzibar had become the largest trading center in East Africa due to their location being a link between the mainland Africa, the Middle East, and India. According to Sultan Seyyid (ruler of Oman) a lot of the slave traders were Arab who were primarily from Oman. 
Not only was he an explorer and hard-core documenter but also an inventor who was driven by his want for writing every detail of history he witnessed first-hand. This seed though is now used all over the world for many teachers to grade answers wrong all over the world lol. 
So, in short there are more than likely more documents either out there or destroyed because although some may have been returned by those who saw his view there were probably many that either were stolen or destroyed by those who didn't support his vision. 
how many in total? 
why is he controversial?
So this is basically a very important document
It is so interesting how a different perspective can help you learn and understand the situation better.
Informs the reader that scholarships will be present on this site.
This shows how revolutionary spectral imaging was a breakthrough in the 19th century.
Sometimes it is easier to learn something when you look at it from a different perspective.
Livingstone online has cemented itself as an import resources for over 20 years.
It's encouraging to see that this has inspired branching projects; not only *that*, but the fact it is so relatively recent too!
Underlining the importance of a "visually enriching" design for the sake of encouraging study--as praised by the Digital Humanities Manifesto!!
Relating to what someone said about how he died at 60: He did not die of natural causes. He died from dysentery and malaria. He also died in Rhodesia or where modern day Zambia exists. 
Crazy that he lived to 60. Especially with being an explorer/ missionary. At that time that was a very old age
This ties back to what digital humanities is really considered, plus its collaborative nature. 
The site isn't designed to make any political statements, it's purpose is to be an information hub on David Livingstone. 
This makes me wonder what the overall largest is, and if theres an effort to archive and preserve it digitally if it isn't already.
Livingstone Online using spectral imaging technology to "transform" 19th century historical artifacts and manuscripts into a visually appealing online site. This allows artifacts from years ago to be stored in a place where they can't be physically stolen, and people from all over the world can access and learn.
 This phrase identifies the subject of the statement ‚Äì a specific project or organization named 'Livingstone Online'. 
I wonder how this site got to Livingstone's information before the government-funded museums and libraries which have had much more power than startup sites like this for hundreds more years since they've been established for much longer. 
I think it's not so much that Livingstone Online got to the manuscripts first. It's that the leaders of this project worked *with* those museums and archives to digitize the records to make them publicly available. Digital Humanities projects often work in tandem with museums and archives, and one motivating factor is that digitization can help preserve the fragile paper records and reduce the costs for researchers to consult them.
It's interesting to see that there are that many more images saved than transcriptions, usually for many archives I've heard about it's the complete opposite where the majority usually have more texts and translations than images. ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwarsroleplayinggame/images/9/96/Jedi_archives.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120228092654)

iMovie was originally released in 1999 for Mac OS 8 and it was just a basic video editor but Kumari used it for way more!
Very interesting that even with all the knowledge we have about this type of study there is still many things unknown about it. 
https://www.nls.uk/about-us/who-and-what/history/ Is a great link to learn more about this Library. But to sum up some of it was founded in the 1680s but officially opened in 1689 with the intent of preserving knowledge of the past. 
The shortened term for Animated Spectral Images in the form of gifs as seen in the gif below. 
It is interesting how we can use todays technology to save the history of the past.
These creations make subtle features and changes across pages more accessible and easier to study, which enhance scholarly engagement with the materials.
It really goes to show how important history is when modern humans spend probably years recovering these texts. 
GIFs are also generally contain smaller file sizes. They also run on 8 bit color, so you are limited to 256 colors. 
This GIF is such a great visual for the different impacts that the different stainings and images have on the visual reading of this field diary page, and how some writings really are invisible to the naked eye. 
I feel like many people process information visually first, which makes images and animations so important to provide. Using them as a tool to further understand a topic is something I think a lot of people don't realize. 
I wonder what else they could've done if developing further ASIs did fall in their grant. Maybe more intricate methods? 
This is a great visual to show the what is being done by technology to the page that lets us read it now. 
like the images on this section of the website.
like the links to the protype work !!!
love how things are evolving in the tech industry and how the creation of it!!! 
like how it talks about the disadvantages of converting the files.
love how its detailed is!! 
love the fact that he talked about the trouble he had with the developing.

crazy that they actually found him at this point only paper maps and Livingstone writing letters would've made it possible
awesome how technology can be used for these things.
wonder what would have happened if this massacre never happened 
The bottom section here of the passage is telling us the director, the sites, and the date with its place of origin.
The field diary from the Livingstone's origin is from 1871.
Makes you realize how much of a game changer spectral imaging is. 
Had a big impact on the public 
This is what the internet is for!! In the age of the internet the theoretical barrier to knowledge is lower than ever before. It is absolutely despicable that some people/groups want to lock up as much of the *world's* history as they can behind their own egregious paywalls and subscription fees. Money. Money. Money.
I thought this sounded familiar!! This quote seems to have percolated through pop culture to some extent, and I am blown away to discover that this is where it came from!
I wonder if technology will continue to improve to the point where we will eventually be able to decipher what was written.
The change from being a reporter, to an explorer, to being involved in the founding of a country is absurd.
Just by knowing how all of this information was recorded tell how much of an interesting life Livingstone lived. 
Wouldn't each revised version of the diary stray further and further away from what he wrote? What if there are mistakes in interpretation?
These are excellent research questions! People can study how much the revised version changed the original now--that's a digital humanities project in itself!
The first hand accounts are very interesting and entertaining. Here are a couple of my favorite quotes from it. "[Kibrinke R is rocky Lohike poisoned arrows]" "I could not listen to it as he has been concocting a mutiny against me" "He invited Rashid to see a cannibal feast by some of his people who had five victims all cut up some pieces roasted and some boiled - saw human flesh actually eaten" 
If Livingstone's writing was never recovered, I wonder how long it would've taken for the world map to get to where it is today.
Henry Morton Stanley was an explorer, author and journalist.
Very unfortunate that we're unable to retrieve everything from Livingstone's writings. 
Well, not until the spectral imaging work of this project!
It's awesome that this story is able to be told so many years later through technological advancement(Spectral Imaging).
love how he ended slavery as well!!!!
Well, Livingstone tried to stop the slave trade, but I don't think he ended it on his own!
love the background of the project and the dates 
This project helped the technology industry, and it pave the way Love this !!!
Like how these images of what he wrote even though I can't see it clearly, it's still evidence. 
NOOOOO!!!! R.I.P Livingstone 
love how this project paved the way for better technology and for it be advanced.
This shows how resourceful Livingstone he was and how dedicated he was to write his diaries 
Love how they talked about how the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project and how it made things better for technology and saved his diary pages 
If spectral imaging technology was available sooner, how many more historical manuscripts/ documents could have been saved?
Similar to many historical documents, Livingstone's 1871 Field Diary was inaccessible to the public due to that fragility and almost illegible script. Spectral imaging technology helped decipher the script and give the public access to these documents without worrying about paper fragility.
He established Belgium as a colonial power of Africa and carried out much pain with violence that lead to the dead of 10 million Africans in the Congo Free State. 
This was witnessed while he was searching for the source of the Nile river which he never found.

Cashdan's research showed how different geographical featured influenced trade.
This trip to Africa had made people think he had gone missing due to him being sick for the entire trip and only 1 of his letters making it back to Europe. This led to a 4 month long search for him across Africa.
This still goes on today and is a big problem in Africa.
Christian missionaries like Livingstone aimed to combat the slave trade while also setting up permanent missions. The competition and occasional cooperation between these faiths created a complex religious environment. That legacy still shapes Malawi today.

Livingstone described the feeling of temporary blindness caused by an environment going from glaring bright to extremely dark, as seen in tropical climates and storm regions/
Nice work finding out more about this! 
This information in written helps historians because there is a lot less room inferences to be made when information on these topics is written out in front of them. 
Before Livingstone's letters, Africa on the Victorian globe was a "blank space", making Livingstone's letters a significant contribution to the globe.

Climatic variability in 19th century Southern Africa included severe drought and multi year wet spells, particularly in the rainfall zone. 
The phrase highlights that 'Livingstone Online' is the main subject of a statement, identifying it as a specific project or organization. This helps clarify the focus of the discussion and signals that further information will relate directly to that entity.
Well, not really. This phrase that you highlighted is about David Livingstone himself and why his writings are important. 
There's a Livingstone Safari in Tanzania that has a couple national parks, a couple places to go for beach holiday like Mafia, Pangani, Pemba, and Zanzibar. They also have a balloon safari [](https://www.livingstonesafaritanzania.com/)

Victoria Falls is one of the world's natural wonders which was found in 1855 by Livingstone when he was paddling down stream there is also a vantage point to see Livingstone Island ![](https://www.zambiatourism.com/media/main-banner-242x242.jpg.webp)
Some of the tribes the Livingstone made contact with were Bakwain, Makololo, Barka, Bakhatls, and the people of Nyangwe
Livingstone used these strategies for improving English language skills, like reading, speaking, and practicing.
Roy C. Bridges was a historian who studied East Africa in the middle years of the nineteenth century, he also was a professor at the University of Aberdeen. He wanted to studied the life of Livingstone.
This challenges the idea that previous assumptions about Livingstone's output, emphasizing a new recognition of the volume of his writing.
